Existing forecasting systems show positive solar irradiance forecasting performance, but most of them are not accurate in real-life especially when there are fast-moving clouds, causing highly fluctuating solar irradiance profile, which is difficult to predict. Moreover, the requirement to pre-train Artificial Intelligence-based forecasting system has made solar irradiance forecasting impractical as long-hour weather profiles need to be collected prior to deployment. This paper proposes a new artificial intelligent algorithm namely the Regression Enhanced Incremental Self-organising Neural Network (RE-SOINN) for accurate (even for highly fluctuating profile) and adaptive solar irradiance forecasting. This algorithm works by learning the time-series solar irradiance data incrementally and predicting it in real-time. It is novel in terms of enabling the learning of data from discrete (as in the conventional) to continuous using the regression method. The proposed algorithm further improves the prediction accuracy by decomposing the input data into two components (low and high frequency components) before feeding into the RE-SOINNs. Results showed that the proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracy compared to the Persistence model, Exponential Smoothing Model and Artificial Neural Networks. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Feature selection is typically considered as a pre-processing mechanism to find an optimal subset of features from a given set of all features in the data mining process. In this article, a novel Hyper Learning Binary Dragonfly Algorithm (HLBDA) is proposed as a wrapper-based method to find an optimal subset of features for a given classification problem. HLBDA is an enhanced version of the Binary Dragonfly Algorithm (BDA) in which a hyper learning strategy is used to assist the algorithm to escape local optima and improve searching behavior. The proposed HLBDA is compared with eight algorithms in the literature. Several assessment indicators are employed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these methods over twenty-one datasets from the University of California Irvine (UCI) repository and Arizona State University. Also, the proposed method is applied to a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) dataset.

This study focuses on developing a model based on deep neural network (DNN) which is an advanced version of artificial neural network (ANN) for the prediction of flyrock based on the data obtained from the Ulu Thiram quarry that is located in Malaysia. To evaluate and document the success and reliability of the new DNN model, an ANN model based on five different data categories from the established database, was also developed and then compared with the DNN model. Based on the obtained results [i.e. coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.9829 and 0.9781, root mean square error (RMSE) = 8.2690 and 9.1119 for DNN and R-2 = 0.9093 and 0.8539, RMSE = 19.0795 and 25.05120 for ANN], a significant increase in predicting flyrock is achieved by developing this DNN predictive model. Then, the DNN model was selected as a function for optimizing flyrock by a powerful optimization technique namely whale optimization algorithm (WOA). The WOA was able to minimize the flyrock resulting from blasting and provide a suitable pattern for blasting operations in mines.","[Guo, Hongquan; Zhou, Jian] Cent South Univ, Sch Resources & Safety Engn, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Koopialipoor, Mohammadreza] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Tehran 15914, Iran; [Jahed Armaghani, Danial] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Tahir, M.

Due to the complexity and non-linearity of this threat, utilizing simple predictive models does not satisfy the required accuracy in analysing the stability of the slopes. Hence, the main objective of this study is to introduce a novel metaheuristic optimization namely Harris hawks' optimization (HHO) for enhancing the accuracy of the conventional multilayer perceptron technique in predicting the factor of safety in the presence of rigid foundations. In this way, four slope stability conditioning factors, namely slope angle, the position of the rigid foundation, the strength of the soil, and applied surcharge are considered. Remarkably, the main contribution of this algorithm to the problem of slope stability lies in adjusting the computational weights of these conditioning factors. The results showed that using the HHO increases the prediction accuracy of the ANN for analysing slopes with unseen conditions. In this regard, it led to reducing the root mean square error and mean absolute error criteria by 20.47% and 26.97%, respectively. Moreover, the correlation between the actual values of the safety factor and the outputs of the HHO-ANN (R-2 = 0.9253) was more significant than the ANN (R-2 = 0.8220). Finally, an HHO-based predictive formula is also presented to be used for similar applications.","[Moayedi, Hossein] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Moayedi, Hossein] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Osouli, Abdolreza] Southern Illinois Univ, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA; [Nguyen, Hoang] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Rashid, Ahmad Safuan A.] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Ctr Trop Geoengn Geotrop, Johor Baharu, Malaysia","Moayedi, H (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.; Moayedi, H (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",hossein.moayedi@tdtu.edu.vn,,"Nguyen, Hoang/0000-0001-6122-8314",,,,58,19,19,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0177-0667,1435-5663,,ENG COMPUT-GERMANY,Eng.

This study proposed a new technique to predict the distance of fly-rock based on an ensemble of support vector regression models (SVRs) and Lasso and elastic-net regularized generalized linear model (GLMNET), called SVRs-GLMNET. It was developed based on a combination of six SVR models and a GLMNET model. Accordingly, the dataset including 210 experimental data was divided into three parts, i.e., training, validating, and testing. Of the whole dataset, 70% was used for the development of the six SVR models first as the sub-models. Subsequently, 20% of the entire dataset (the validating dataset) was used to predict fly-rock based on the six developed SVR models. The predicted results from the six developed SVR models were used as the input variables to establish the GLMNET model (i.e., SVRs-GLMNET model). Finally, the remaining 10% of the dataset was used for testing the performance of the proposed SVRs-GLMNET model. A comparison and evaluation of the six developed SVR models and the proposed SVRs-GLMNET model were implemented based on five statistical criteria, such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), variance account for (VAF), and determination of correlation (R-2). The results indicated that the proposed SVRs-GLMNET model provided the most dominant performance in predicting the distance of fly-rock caused by bench blasting in this study with an RMSE of 3.737, R-2 of 0.993, MAE of 3.214, MAPE of 0.018, and VAF of 99.207.

Almost the whole world, at some point of time, was placed in lock-down in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus, with resulting psychological and economic sequela. As countries start to ease lock-down measures and reopen industries, ensuring a healthy workplace for employees has become imperative. Thus, this paper presents a mobile app-based intelligent portable healthcare (pHealth) tool, called i WorkSafe, to assist industries in detecting possible suspects for COVID-19 infection among their employees who may need primary care. Developed mainly for low-end Android devices, the i WorkSafe app hosts a fuzzy neural network model that integrates data of employees' health status from the industry's database, proximity and contact tracing data from the mobile devices, and user-reported COVID-19 self-test data. Using the built-in Bluetooth low energy sensing technology and K Nearest Neighbor and K-means techniques, the app is capable of tracking users' proximity and trace contact with other employees. Additionally, it uses a logistic regression model to calculate the COVID-19 self-test score and a Bayesian Decision Tree model for checking real-time health condition from an intelligent e-health platform for further clinical attention of the employees. Rolled out in an apparel factory on 12 employees as a test case, the pHealth tool generates an alert to maintain social distancing among employees inside the industry. In addition, the app helps employees to estimate risk with possible COVID-19 infection based on the collected data and found that the score is effective in estimating personal health condition of the app user.","[Kaiser, M.

Our work on a 10nm SoC product showed that the topology and algorithm managed to produce averagely 16.98% better global skew, 42.75% less divergence on critical clock paths and with 64.5% shorter clock balancing phase compared to a conventional ASIC methodology.","[Teh, Eng Keong; Zawawi, Mohamad Adzhar Md; Mohamed, Mohamed Fauzi Packeer; Isa, Nor Ashidi Mat] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Engn Campus, Nibong Tebal 14300, Malaysia; [Teh, Eng Keong] Intel Microelect Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Bayan Lepas 11900, Malaysia","Isa, NAM (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Engn Campus, Nibong Tebal 14300, Malaysia.",ashidi@usm.my,"Isa, Nor Ashidi Mat/I-7826-2017","Isa, Nor Ashidi Mat/0000-0002-2675-4914","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, through the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [203/PELECT/6071398]","This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, through the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme, under Grant 203/PELECT/6071398.",,69,0,0,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,9,,,,,,14816,14835,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3053052,,,20,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,QA1PN,WOS:000613221700001,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

Integral to that is analyzing the current performance of each task of the process and assigning the most appropriate resources to each task. In continuation of our previous work, we categorize resources into human and non-human resources. For instance, in the healthcare domain, human resources include doctors, nurses, and other associated staff responsible for the execution of healthcare activities; whereas the non-human resources include surgical and other equipment needed for execution. In this study, we contend that the two types of resources (human and non-human) have a different impact on the process performance, so their suitability should be measured differently. However, no work has been done to evaluate the suitability of non-human resources for the tasks of a process. Consequently, it becomes difficult to identify and subsequently overcome the inefficiencies caused by the non-human resources to the task. To address this problem, we present a three-step method to compute a suitability score of non-human resources for the task. As an evaluation of the proposed method, a healthcare case study is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. Furthermore, we performed a controlled experiment to evaluate the usability of the proposed method. The encouraging response shows the usefulness of the proposed method.","[Sohail, Abid] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Comp Sci, Lahore, Pakistan; [Shahzad, Khurram; Butt, Muhammad Arif] Univ Punjab, Punjab Univ Coll Informat Technol, Lahore, Pakistan; [Dominic, P.

Problematic and unstable processes may produce distinct time series patterns that could be associated with assignable causes for diagnosis purpose. Various machine learning classification techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN), classification and regression tree (CART), and fuzzy inference system have been proposed to enhance the capability of traditional Shewhart control chart for process monitoring and diagnosis. ANN classifiers are often opaque to the user with limited interpretability on the classification procedures. However, fuzzy inference system and CART are more transparent, and the internal steps are more comprehensible to users. There have been limited works comparing these two techniques in the control chart pattern recognition (CCPR) domain. As such, the aim of this paper is to demonstrate the development of fuzzy heuristics and CART technique for CCPR and compare their classification performance. The results show the heuristics Mamdani fuzzy classifier performed well in classification accuracy (95.76%) but slightly lower compared to CART classifier (98.58%).

Researchers have been leveraging on various Artificial Intelligence techniques as an alternative to medical approach in understanding the virus. Limited studies have, however, reported on COVID-19 transmission pattern analysis, and using geography features for prediction of potential outbreak sites. Predicting the next most probable outbreak site is crucial, particularly for optimizing the planning of medical personnel and supply resources. To tackle the challenge, this work proposed distance-based similarity measures to predict the next most probable outbreak site together with its magnitude, when would the outbreak likely to happen and the duration of the outbreak. The work began with preprocessing of 1365 patient records from six districts in the most populated state named Selangor in Malaysia. The dataset was then aggregated with population density information and human elicited geography features that might promote the transmission of COVID-19. Empirical findings indicated that the proposed unified decision-making approach outperformed individual distance metric in predicting the total cases, next outbreak location, and the time interval between start dates of two similar sites. Such findings provided valuable insights for policymakers to perform Active Case Detection.","[Ting, Choo-Yee; Cheng, Darryl Lin-Wei; Tan, Nicholas Yu-Zhe] Multimedia Univ, Cyberjaya 63100, Malaysia; [Zakariah, Helmi; Kamaludin, Fadzilah; Yee, Hui-Jia] AIME Healthcare Sdn Bhd, Kuala Lumpur 59200, Malaysia","Ting, CY (corresponding author), Multimedia Univ, Cyberjaya 63100, Malaysia.",cyting@mmu.edu.my,,,,,,45,0,0,0,0,TECH SCIENCE PRESS,HENDERSON,"871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA",1546-2218,1546-2226,,CMC-COMPUT MATER CON,CMC-Comput.

On the other hand, the feasibility of artificial intelligence techniques in solving geotechnical engineering problems is underlined in literature. This paper is aimed to show the workability of two soft computing techniques in predicting the deformation of GRS structures. For this reason, first a relevant case study was modelled into ABAQUS, a finite element (FE) software. Then, the FE results (GRS deformations) were checked against the recorded deformations of the full-scale test. Subsequently, 166 finite element analyses were performed for dataset construction. Then, two predictive models of GRS deformations were constructed. For intelligent model construction, two artificial neural networks (ANN) were coupled with Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), respectively. It was found that both GSA-based ANN and PSO-based ANN predictive models work good enough. However, the correlation coefficient (R) of 0.981 as well as the system error of 0.0101 for testing data suggest that the GSA-based ANN predictive model outperforms the PSO-based ANN model with R value of 0.973 and system error of 0.0127. Overall, findings recommend that the proposed models can be implemented in assessing the performance of geosynthetic reinforced soil structures.","[Momeni, Ehsan; Yarivand, Akbar; Dowlatshahi, Mohammad Bagher] Lorestan Univ, Fac Engn, Khorramabad 6815144316, Iran; [Armaghani, Danial Jahed] Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Momeni, E (corresponding author), Lorestan Univ, Fac Engn, Khorramabad 6815144316, Iran.",Momeni.e@lu.ac.ir; Yarivand.A@lu.ac.ir; dowlatshahi.mb@lu.ac.ir; danialarmaghani@um.edu.my,"Momeni, Ehsan/G-8788-2018","Momeni, Ehsan/0000-0003-4084-485X",Lorestan University [995032299],The authors would like to thank the Research and Technology Deputy of Lorestan University for providing enough support through research vote: 995032299 to bring the idea into fruition.

A feature selection (FS) algorithm called extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is proposed to abstract the correlated input parameters for the Pb prediction and validated against principal component of analysis (PCA), recursive feature elimination (RFE), and the genetic algorithm (GA). XGBoost model is applied using a grid search strategy (Grid-XGBoost) for predicting Pb and validated against the commonly used AI models, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The input parameter selection approaches redimensioned the 21 parameters into 9-5 parameters without losing their learned information over the models' training phase. At the BB station, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values (0.06, 0.32, 0.34, and 0.33) were achieved for the XGBoost-SVM, XGBoost-ANN, XGBoost-Grid-XGBoost, and Grid-XGBoost models, respectively. At the DB station, the lowest MAPE values, 0.25 and 0.24, were attained for the XGBoost-Grid-XGBoost and Grid-XGBoost models, respectively.

It is efficient because it facilitates the implementation of data acquisition and data management methods, as well as data representation and dashboard configuration. The platform allows for the use of any type of data source, ranging from the measurements of a multi-functional IoT sensing devices to relational and non-relational databases. It is also smart because it incorporates a complete artificial intelligence suit for data analysis; it includes techniques for data classification, clustering, forecasting, optimization, visualization, etc. It is also compatible with the edge computing concept, allowing for the distribution of intelligence and the use of intelligent sensors. The concept of smart cities is evolving and adapting to new applications; the trend to create intelligent neighbourhoods, districts or territories is becoming increasingly popular, as opposed to the previous approach of managing an entire megacity. In this paper, the platform is presented, and its architecture and functionalities are described. Moreover, its operation has been validated in a case study where the bike renting service of Paris-Velib' Metropole has been managed. This platform could enable smart territories to develop adapted knowledge management systems, adapt them to new requirements and to use multiple types of data, and execute efficient computational and artificial intelligence algorithms. The platform optimizes the decisions taken by human experts through explainable artificial intelligence models that obtain data from IoT sensors, databases, the Internet, etc. The global intelligence of the platform could potentially coordinate its decision-making processes with intelligent nodes installed in the edge, which would use the most advanced data processing techniques.","[Corchado, Juan M.; Chamoso, Pablo; Camacho, Alberto Rivas; Pinto-Santos, Francisco; Goyenechea, Enrique; Garcia-Retuerta, David; Alonso-Miguel, Maria; Hernandez, Beatriz Bellido; Villaverde, Diego Valdeolmillos; Plaza-Martinez, Pablo; Lopez-Perez, Manuel; Manzano-Garcia, Sergio; Casado-Vara, Roberto; Tejedor, Javier Prieto; Prieta, Fernando de la; Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Sara; Parra-Dominguez, Javier] Univ Salamanca, BISITE Res Grp, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Corchado, Juan M.; Chamoso, Pablo; Hernandez, Guillermo; Gutierrez, Agustin San Roman; Sanchez-Verdejo, Manuel; Alonso, Ricardo S.; Tejedor, Javier Prieto] IoT Digital Innovat Hub, Air Inst, Salamanca 37188, Spain; [Corchado, Juan M.] Osaka Inst Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Elect Informat & Commun, Osaka 5358585, Japan; [Gonzalez-Briones, Alfonso] Univ Complutense Madrid, Res Grp Agent Based Social & Interdisciplinary Ap, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Mohamad, Mohd Saberi] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Inst Artificial Intelligence & Big Data, Kelantan 16100, Malaysia; [Trabelsi, Saber] Texas A&M Univ Qatar, Doha 23874, Qatar; [Diaz-Plaza, Enrique] IBM Corp, Madrid 28108, Spain; [Garcia-Coria, Jose Alberto] Viewnext, Madrid 28036, Spain; [Yigitcanlar, Tan] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Novais, Paulo] Univ Minho, ALGORITMI Ctr, Dept Informat, P-4710070 Braga, Portugal; [Omatu, Sigeru] Hiroshima Univ, Div Data Driven Smart Syst, Digital Mfg Educ & Res Ctr, Hiroshima 7398511, Japan","Corchado, JM (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, BISITE Res Grp, Salamanca 37007, Spain.; Corchado, JM (corresponding author), IoT Digital Innovat Hub, Air Inst, Salamanca 37188, Spain.; Corchado, JM (corresponding author), Osaka Inst Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Elect Informat & Commun, Osaka 5358585, Japan.",corchado@usal.es; chamoso@usal.es; agustinsrg@air-institute.org; rivis@usal.es; alfonsogb@ucm.es; franpintosantos@usal.es; egoyene@usal.es; dvid@usal.es; mamg@usal.es; beatriz_bellido@usal.es; dval@usal.es; mverdejo@air-institute.org; Pablosk1997@usal.es; manulpb@usal.es; smanzano@usal.es; ralonso@air-institute.org; rober@usal.es; javierp@usal.es; fer@usal.es; srg@usal.es; javierparra@usal.es; saberi@umk.edu.my; saber.trabelsi@qatar.tamu.edu; enrique.diaz-plaza@es.ibm.com; jalberto@usal.es; tan.yigitcanlar@qut.edu.au; pjon@di.uminho.pt; omatsu@hirosima-u.ac.jp,"Yigitcanlar, Tan/J-1142-2012; Corchado, Juan M/D-3229-2013; Hernandez, Guillermo/X-3634-2018; De la Prieta, Fernando/H-4738-2015; Alonso Rincon, Ricardo S./W-8845-2018; Casado Vara, Roberto/Q-3575-2018; Prieto, Javier/H-3704-2015; MOHAMAD, MOHD SABERI/J-3201-2014; Chamoso, Pablo/A-7274-2016; Gonzalez Briones, Alfonso/B-2571-2016","Yigitcanlar, Tan/0000-0001-7262-7118; Corchado, Juan M/0000-0002-2829-1829; Parra-Dominguez, Javier/0000-0002-1088-9152; Hernandez, Guillermo/0000-0002-7481-5961; De la Prieta, Fernando/0000-0002-8239-5020; Alonso Rincon, Ricardo S./0000-0002-6599-0186; Casado Vara, Roberto/0000-0003-0198-696X; Prieto, Javier/0000-0001-8175-2201; Garcia Retuerta, David/0000-0003-2351-068X; MOHAMAD, MOHD SABERI/0000-0002-1079-4559; Manzano, Sergio/0000-0002-7768-3124; Pinto-Santos, Francisco/0000-0002-9500-9336; Chamoso, Pablo/0000-0001-5109-3583; Gonzalez Briones, Alfonso/0000-0002-3444-4393; Rivas, Alberto/0000-0002-9558-9895","European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Interreg Spain-Portugal V-A Program (POCTEP) [0677_DISRUPTIVE_2_E]; project My-TRAC: My TRAvel Companion [H2020-S2RJU-2017]; project LAPASSION, CITIES [CYTED 518RT0558]; company DCSC; Santander Iberoamerican Research Grants","This work has been partially supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Interreg Spain-Portugal V-A Program (POCTEP) under grant 0677_DISRUPTIVE_2_E, the project My-TRAC: My TRAvel Companion (H2020-S2RJU-2017), the project LAPASSION, CITIES (CYTED 518RT0558) and the company DCSC.

These works span a wide range of research areas to enhance telemedicine architecture such as network communications, artificial intelligence methods and techniques, IoT wearable sensors and hardware devices, smartphones and cloud computing. Accordingly, several telemedicine applications covering various human diseases have presented their works from a specific perspective and resulted in confusion regarding the IoT characteristics. Although such applications are useful and necessary for improving telemedicine contexts related to monitoring, detection and diagnostics, deriving an overall picture of how IoT characteristics are currently integrated with the telemedicine architecture is difficult. Accordingly, this study complements the academic literature with a systematic review covering all main aspects of advances in IoT-based telemedicine architecture. This study also provides a state-of-the-art telemedicine classification taxonomy under IoT and reviews works in different fields in relation to that classification. To this end, this study checked the ScienceDirect, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, and Web of Science databases. A total of 2121 papers were collected from 2014 to July 2020. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the defined inclusion criteria. A final set of 141 articles were selected and classified into two categories, each followed by subcategories and sections. The first category includes an IoT-based telemedicine network that accounts for 24.11% (n = 34/141). The second category includes IoT-based telemedicine healthcare services and applications that account for 75.89% (n = 107/141). This multi-field systematic review has exposed new research opportunities, motivations, recommendations and challenges that need attention for the synergistic integration of interdisciplinary works. This extensive study also lists a set of open issues and provides innovative key solutions along with a systematic review. The classification of diseases under IoT-based telemedicine is divided into 14 groups. Furthermore, the crossover in our taxonomy is demonstrated. The lifecycle of the context of IoT-based telemedicine healthcare applications is mapped for the first time, including the procedure sequencing and definition for each context. We believe that this study is a useful guide for researchers and practitioners in providing direction and valuable information for future research. This study can also address the ambiguity in the trends in IoT-based telemedicine.","[Albahri, A. S.; Zaidan, A. A.; Albahri, O. S.; Zaidan, B. B.; Alamoodi, A.

Such detections are usually performed with the aid of computers. Using high-level simulations, this study investigates and evaluates three automated age-related macular degeneration (AMD) detection flows in terms of computation time and detection accuracy for future hardware-accelerated designs of intelligent and portable OCT systems. In this study, a block-matching and 3-Dimension filter (BM3DF), a hybrid median filter (HMF), and an adaptive wiener filter (AWF) are used to denoise the OCT images. Support vector machine (SVM), AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and Inception-ResNet are employed for AMD detection. Moreover, Local binary patterns, linear configuration patterns, and transfer learning techniques are used to extract image features. Simulation results reveal that machine-learning-based automated AMD detection realizes a high detection accuracy of 95.91% accompanied by low computation time when using the HMF rather than the BM3DF. When considering deep-learning-based automated AMD detection, the combination of HMF and Inception-ResNet achieves the highest detection accuracy of 98.64% but is accompanied by a dramatic increase in computation time. However, only AlexNet achieves a detection accuracy of 96.40%, accompanied by low computation time. In this study, the tradeoffs between the computation time and detection accuracy have been revealed by comparing the denoising methods for the distinct automated AMD detections.","[Lin, Cheng-Hung; Liao, Wei-Ming; Liang, Jing-Wen; Chen, Po-Han; Ko, Cheng-En; Yang, Chih-Hao] Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Jhongli 32003, Taiwan; [Lin, Cheng-Hung; Yang, Chih-Hao] Yuan Ze Univ, Biomed Engn Res Ctr, Jhongli 32003, Taiwan; [Lu, Cheng-Kai] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia","Lin, CH (corresponding author), Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Jhongli 32003, Taiwan.; Lu, CK (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.",chlin@saturnyzu.edu.tw; chengkai.lu@utp.edu.my,,"Lin, Cheng-Hung/0000-0001-8373-2271; Lu, ChengKai/0000-0002-5819-0754","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 107-2221-E-155-057, MOST 108-2221-E-155-046, 015LC0-002]","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under Grant MOST 107-2221-E-155-057 and Grant MOST 108-2221-E-155-046; and in part by the YUTP-Fundamental Research Grant under Grant 015LC0-002.",,42,0,0,4,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1530-437X,1558-1748,,IEEE SENS J,IEEE Sens.

This work reveals that too much research attention was invested in making data-driven models, as supposed to ensuring the quality of industrial data. Furthermore, the true challenge within the In-dustry 4.0 is with data communication and infrastructure problems, not so significantly on developing modelling techniques. Current methods and data infrastructures for industrial energy savings were comprehensively reviewed to showcase the potential for a more accurate and effective digital twin-based infrastructure for the industry. With a few more development in enabling technologies such as 5G developments, Internet of Things (IoT) standardization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain 3.0 utilization, it is but a matter of time that the industry will transition towards the digital twin-based approach. Global government efforts and policies are already inclining towards leveraging better industrial energy efficiencies and energy savings. This provides a promising future for the development of a digital twin-based energy-saving system in the industry. Foreseeing some potential challenges, this paper also discusses the importance of symbiosis between researchers and industrialists to transition from traditional industry towards a digital twin-based energy-saving industry. The novelty of this work is the current context of industrial energy savings was extended towards cutting-edge technologies for Industry 4.0. Furthermore, this work proposes to standardize and modularize industrial data infrastructure for smart energy savings. This work also serves as a concise guideline for researchers and industrialists who are looking to implement advanced energy-saving systems.","[Teng, Sin Yong; Tous, Michal; Masa, Vitezslav] Brno Univ Technol, Inst Proc Engn, Tech 2896-2, Brno 61669, Czech Republic; [Teng, Sin Yong; Tous, Michal; Masa, Vitezslav] NETME Ctr, Tech 2896-2, Brno 61669, Czech Republic; [Leong, Wei Dong; Lam, Hon Loong] Univ Nottingham, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Malaysia Campus,Jalan Broga, Semenyih 43500, Selangor, Malaysia; [How, Bing Shen] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Res Ctr Sustainable Technol, Jalan Simpang Tiga, Sarawak 93350, Malaysia","Teng, SY; Tous, M (corresponding author), Brno Univ Technol, Inst Proc Engn, Tech 2896-2, Brno 61669, Czech Republic.; Teng, SY; Tous, M (corresponding author), NETME Ctr, Tech 2896-2, Brno 61669, Czech Republic.",sin.yong.teng@vut.cz; tous@fme.vutbr.cz; leongweidong@gmail.com; bshow@swinburne.edu.my; HonLoong.Lam@nottingham.edu.my; masa@fme.vutbr.cz,"Yong, Teng Sin/V-3902-2019","Yong, Teng Sin/0000-0002-2988-8053","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic under OP RDE [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008413]","The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic under OP RDE [grant number CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008413] Strategic Partnership for Environmental Technologies and Energy Production.",,281,0,0,51,51,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

The accurate and more reliable prediction of TDG has a very significant role in preserving the diversity of aquatic organisms and reducing the phenomenon of fish deaths. Herein, two machine learning approaches called support vector regression (SVR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) have been applied to predict the saturated TDG% at USGS 14150000 and USGS 14181500 stations which are located in the USA. For the USGS 14150000 station, the recorded samples from 13 October 2016 to 14 March 2019 (75%) were used for training set, and the rest from 15 March 2019 to 13 October 2019 (25%) were used for testing requirements. Similarly, for USGS 14181500 station, the hourly data samples which covered the period from 9 June 2017 till 11 March 2019 were used for calibrating the models and from 12 March 2019 until 9 October 2019 were used for testing the predictive models. Eight input combinations based on different parameters have been established as well as nine statistical performance measures have been used for evaluating the accuracy of adopted models, for instance, not limited, correlation of determination (R-2), mean absolute relative error (MAE), and uncertainty at 95% (U95). The obtained results of the study for both stations revealed that the ELM managed efficiently to estimate the TDG in comparison to SVR technique. For USGS 14181500 station, the statistical measures for ELM (SVR) were, respectively, reported as R-2 of 0.986 (0.986), MAE of 0.316 (0.441), and U95 of 3.592 (3.869). Lastly, for USGS 14181500 station, the statistical measures for ELM (SVR) were, respectively, reported as R-2 of 0.991 (0.991), MAE of 0.338 (0.396), and U95 of 0.832 (0.837). In addition, ELM's training process computational time is stated to be much shorter than that of SVM. The results also showed that the temperature parameter was the most significant variable that influenced TDG relative to the other parameters. Overall, the proposed model (ELM) proved to be an appropriate and efficient computer-assisted technology for saturated TDG modeling that will contribute to the basic knowledge of environmental considerations.","[AlOmar, Mohamed Khalid; Hameed, Mohammed Majeed] Al Maaref Univ Coll, Dept Civil Engn, Ramadi, Iraq; [Al-Ansari, Nadhir] Lulea Univ Technol, Civil Engn Dept, Environm & Nat Resources Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [AlSaadi, Mohammed Abdulhakim] Univ Nizwa, Natl Chair Mat Sci & Met, Nizwa, Oman; [AlSaadi, Mohammed Abdulhakim] Univ Malaya, Nanotechnol & Catalysis Res Ctr NANOCAT, IPS Bldg, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","AlOmar, MK (corresponding author), Al Maaref Univ Coll, Dept Civil Engn, Ramadi, Iraq.",mohd.alomar@yahoo.com; mohmmag1@gmail.com; nadhir.alansari@ltu.se; m.hakim@unizwa.edu.om,"Hameed, Mohammed Majeed/E-6577-2019; AlOmar, Mohamed/E-8830-2016","Hameed, Mohammed Majeed/0000-0002-9366-9162; AlOmar, Mohamed/0000-0001-7008-9416; Al-Ansari, Nadhir/0000-0002-6790-2653",AlMaarif University College,The authors would like to express their thanks to AlMaarif University College for funding this research.,,63,0,0,0,0,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-8086,1687-8094,,ADV CIV ENG,Adv.

In this study, a silicon neuron transistor is developed using the neuroscience approach for AGI applications. Neuronal behavior (weighted sum and threshold function) is based on the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) negative differential resistance (NDR) theory. The neuron transistor is implemented by the UMC 180-nm commercial standard CMOS process, which is beneficial to implement an entire neural network or integrate with other CMOS circuits on the same chip. The neuron transistor is composed of three inputs V-g1, V-g2, and V-g3 and a control terminal, V-con a load terminal, V-b(load), and a driver terminal, V-b(driver) respectively. The width of each input is 1.8 mu m, and the inputs have 1, 2, and 4 fingers respectively, that is, the weight ratio is 1:2:4. V-b(load) and V-b(driver) enable a neuron transistor to function more closely resembles a real biological neuron, with improved sensitivity and less complexity comparing to a traditional artificial neural network. The neuron MOS transistor was measured at the maximum frequency of 10 kHz. It had an extremely low power consumption of <10(-4 )mu W and a miniscule footprint 30 x 15 mu m(2). As the process feature size decreases, the chip's operating frequency could be increased by one order of magnitude, while its power consumption and footprint will decrease.","[Zhao, Fan; Jia, Cong; Huo, Dongquan] Tianjin Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Guo, Weilian; Xie, Sheng; Chang, Yanyan; Jiang, Huaiyan] Tianjin Univ, Sch Microelect, Tianjin Key Lab Imaging & Sensing Microelect Tech, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yan] Hebei Normal Univ, Coll Phys, Shijiazhuang 050024, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Tee, Clarence Augustine T.

The manual inspection and monitoring of livestock are tedious since the cattle do not stay at fixed locations. Fencing many cattle requires a considerable cost and involves farmers' physical intervention to keep an eye to stop them from crossing beyond the access points. Visual tracking of livestock and fencing is a time-consuming and challenging job. This research proposes a smart solution for livestock tracking and geofencing using state-of-the-art IoT technology. The study creates a geographical safe zone for cattle based on IoT and GPRS, where the cattle are assigned dedicated IoT sensors. The cattle can be easily remotely monitored and controlled without having any need for farmers to intervene for livestock management physically. The smart system collects the data regarding the location, well-being, and health of the livestock. This kind of livestock management may help prevent the spread of COVID-19, lower the farming costs, and enable remote monitoring.","[Ilyas, Qazi Mudassar] King Faisal Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Al Hufuf, Saudi Arabia; [Ahmad, Muneer] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Ilyas, QM (corresponding author), King Faisal Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Al Hufuf, Saudi Arabia.",qilyas@kfu.edu.sa; mmalik@um.edu.my,"Ilyas, Mudassar/AAF-4718-2021","Ilyas, Mudassar/0000-0003-4238-8093","Deputyship for Research & Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia [IFT20172]","The authors extend their appreciation to the Deputyship for Research & Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia for funding this research work through the project number IFT20172.",,54,0,0,2,2,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1530-8669,1530-8677,,WIREL COMMUN MOB COM,Wirel.

Yet, it typically suffers from outliers and noise which often need to be post-processed. Although many algorithms are able to effectively remove the outliers, most require a certain amount of manual tuning of the parameter(s) or to have a parameter(s) set based on the rule of thumb. New machine learning and artificial intelligence-based methods have also been introduced but may require vast parallel computing resources as well as training data. In the present study, a novel combinatory-distance-based method capable of high accuracy outlier detection named as the sorted distance divergence point (SDDP) is introduced. Results show that SDDP is able to achieve an average accuracy of 98% in outlier detection. Moreover, the introduced distance function and outlier percentage allow clear labelling of inliers and outliers cloud points. Therefore, SDDP presents an attractive enhancement to existing methods; namely, the manual parameter(s) tuning may not be necessary. The adaptability and utility of SDDP is further demonstrated by incorporating SDDP with current methods, to produce a high accuracy outlier detector. When tested with 17 objects with 20-50% outliers, attain F1 and F2 scores averaging 0.960 and 0.968, respectively.","[Goh, Michael Joon Seng; Chiew, Yeong Shiong; Foo, Ji Jinn] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Engn, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia","Goh, MJS (corresponding author), Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Engn, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia.",michael.goh@monash.edu,,,Monash University MalaysiaMonash University [MUM-24714739],This study was supported by Monash University Malaysia (Project code: MUM-24714739).,,33,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1751-9659,1751-9667,,IET IMAGE PROCESS,IET Image Process.,DEC,2020,14,14,,,,,3414,3421,,10.1049/iet-ipr.2020.0334,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Computer Science; Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,PO7RB,WOS:000605364800013,,,,,11/3/2021

The latest to appear on the scene is bringing convenience in how agriculture can be done by employing various computational technologies. There are lots of factors that affect agricultural production, with seed quality topping the list. Seed classification can provide additional knowledge about quality production, seed quality control and impurity identification. The process of categorising seeds has been traditionally done based on characteristics like colour, shape and texture. Generally, this is performed by specialists by visually inspecting each sample, which is a very tedious and time-consuming task. This procedure can be easily automated, providing a significantly more efficient method for seed sorting than having them be inspected using human labour. In related areas, computer vision technology based on machine learning (ML), symmetry and, more particularly, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been generously applied, often resulting in increased work efficiency. Considering the success of the computational intelligence methods in other image classification problems, this research proposes a classification system for seeds by employing CNN and transfer learning. The proposed system contains a model that classifies 14 commonly known seeds with the implication of advanced deep learning techniques. The techniques applied in this research include decayed learning rate, model checkpointing and hybrid weight adjustment. This research applies symmetry when sampling the images of the seeds during data formation. The application of symmetry generates homogeneity with regards to resizing and labelling the images to extract their features. This resulted in 99% classification accuracy during the training set. The proposed model produced results with an accuracy of 99% for the test set, which contained 234 images. These results were much higher than the results reported in related research.","[Gulzar, Yonis; Soomro, Arjumand Bano] King Faisal Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Management Informat Syst, Al Hasa 31982, Saudi Arabia; [Hamid, Yasir] AbuDhabi Polytech Coll, Informat Secur & Engn Technol, Abu Dhabi 111499, U Arab Emirates; [Alwan, Ali A.] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Gombak 53100, Selangor, Malaysia; [Journaux, Ludovic] Burgundy Univ, AgroSup Informat Lab, F-21078 Dijon, France","Gulzar, Y; Soomro, AB (corresponding author), King Faisal Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Management Informat Syst, Al Hasa 31982, Saudi Arabia.; Hamid, Y (corresponding author), AbuDhabi Polytech Coll, Informat Secur & Engn Technol, Abu Dhabi 111499, U Arab Emirates.",ygulzar@kfu.edu.sa; yasir.hamid@adploy.ac.ae; asoomro@kfu.edu.sa; aliamer@iium.edu.my; ludovic.journaux@agrosupdijon.fr,"Gulzar, Yonis/X-6394-2019","Gulzar, Yonis/0000-0002-6515-1569; ALWAN, ALI/0000-0003-3279-9366","Deputyship for Research & Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia [IFT20056]","This research study has been funded by Deputyship for Research & Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia: Project number IFT20056.",,26,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-8994,,SYMMETRY-BASEL,Symmetry-Basel,DEC,2020,12,12,,,,,,,2018,10.3390/sym12122018,,,18,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,PK3TM,WOS:000602371800001,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,11/3/2021

As Malaysia experiences a tropical climate with intense rainfall occurring throughout the year, accurate rainfall simulations are particularly important to provide information for climate change assessment and hydrological modelling. An artificial intelligence-based hybrid model, the bootstrap aggregated classification tree-artificial neural network (BACT-ANN) model, was proposed for simulating rainfall occurrences and amounts over the Langat River Basin, Malaysia. The performance of this proposed BACT-ANN model was evaluated and compared with the stochastic non-homogeneous hidden Markov model (NHMM). The observed daily rainfall series for the years 1975-2012 at four rainfall stations have been selected. It was found that the BACT-ANN model performed better however, with slight underproductions of the wet spell lengths. The BACT-ANN model scored better for the probability of detection (POD), false alarm rate (FAR) and the Heidke skill score (HSS). The NHMM model tended to overpredict the rainfall occurrence while being less capable with the statistical measures such as distribution, equality, variance and statistical correlations of rainfall amount. Overall, the BACT-ANN model was considered the more effective tool for the purpose of simulating the rainfall characteristics in Langat River Basin.","[Lian, Chau Yuan; Huang, Yuk Feng; Koo, Chai Hoon] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ng, Jing Lin] UCSI Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn Technol & Built Environm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Mirzaei, Majid] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Tan, Kok Weng] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Dept Environm Engn, Fac Engn & Green Technol, Selangor, Malaysia","Huang, YF (corresponding author), Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia.",huangyf@utar.edu.my,"Mirzaei, Majid/J-2318-2017; Ng, Jing Lin/AAE-2518-2021; Ng, Jing Lin/AAD-4048-2019",,"Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia; Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia","The authors would like to express their sincere appreciation to the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia and the Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia, for providing the funds for this study.",,28,2,2,3,3,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",2040-2244,,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

Observed SPEIs from periods 1976 to 2011 and 2012 to 2015 were used for model training and validation, respectively. By applying the MAE, RMSE, MBE and R-2 as model assessments, it was found that the F-SVR model was best with the trend of improving accuracy when the timescale of the SPEIs increased. It was also found that differences in model performance deteriorates with increased timescale of the SPEIs.

Predicting air pollution is critical for air quality research, as it affects public health. The Air Pollution Index (API) is a convenient tool to describe air quality. Air pollution predictions can provide accurate information on the future pollution situation, effectively controlling air pollution. Governments have expressed growing concern about air pollution due to its global effect on human health and sustainable growth. This paper proposes a novel forecasting model using One-Dimensional Deep Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) and Exponential Adaptive Gradients (EAG) optimization to predict API for a selected location, Klang, a city in Malaysia. The proposed 1D-CNN-EAG exponentially accumulates past model gradients to adaptively tune the learning rate and converge in both convex and non-convex areas. We use hourly air pollution data over three years (January 2012 to December 2014) for training. Parameter optimization and model evaluation was accomplished by a grid-search with k-folds cross-validation. Results have confirmed that the proposed approach achieves better prediction accuracy than the benchmark models in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the Correlation Coefficient (R-Squared) with values of 2.036, 2.354, 4.214 and 0.966, respectively, and time complexity.","[Ragab, Mohammed G.; Abdulkadir, Said J.; Aziz, Norshakirah; Al-Tashi, Qasem; Alhussian, Hitham; Alqushaibi, Alawi] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Abdulkadir, Said J.; Aziz, Norshakirah; Alhussian, Hitham] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Ctr Res Data Sci CERDAS, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Al-Tashi, Qasem] Univ Albaydha, Fac Adm & Comp Sci, Radaa CV46 6X, Albaydha, Yemen; [Alyousifi, Yousif] Univ Kebangsaan, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, Bangi 43600, Malaysia","Abdulkadir, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.; Abdulkadir, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Ctr Res Data Sci CERDAS, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.",mohd.gamal_20497@utp.edu.my; saidjadid.a@utp.edu.my; norshakirah.aziz@utp.edu.my; qasem_17004490@utp.edu.my; p90499@siswa.ukm.edu.my; seddig.alhussian@utp.edu.my; alawi_18000555@utp.edu.my,"Abdulkadir, Said Jadid/T-9616-2019; Al-Tashi, Qasem/O-1632-2019","Abdulkadir, Said Jadid/0000-0003-0038-3702; Al-Tashi, Qasem/0000-0001-7208-693X; G.

Humans have always been in the quest to find strategies to avoid diseases that are life-threatening or affect the quality of life of humans. Effective use of resources available to human to control different diseases has always been critical. Researchers are recently more interested to find AI-based solutions to control the human population from diseases due to the overwhelming popularity of deep learning. There are many supervised techniques that have always been applied for disease diagnosis. However, the main problem of supervised based solutions is the availability of data, which is not always possible or not always complete. For instance, we do not have enough data that shows the different states of humans and different states of environments, and how all different actions taken by humans or viruses have ultimately resulted in a disease that eventually takes the lives of humans. Therefore, there is a need to find unsupervised based solutions or some techniques that do not have a dependency on the underlying dataset. In this paper, we have explored the reinforcement learning approach. We have tried different reinforcement learning algorithms to research different solutions for the prevention of diseases in the simulation of the human population. We have explored different techniques for controlling the transmission of diseases and its effects on health in the human population simulated in an environment. Our algorithms have found out policies that are best for the human population to protect themselves from the transmission and infection of malaria. The paper concludes that deep learning-based algorithms such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) have outperformed traditional algorithms such as Q-Learning or SARSA.","[Alam Khan, Zahid; Feng, Zhengyong] China West Normal Univ, Nanchong, Peoples R China; [Uddin, M.

Their remarkable potential has led to numerous medical discoveries and breakthroughs in science. As a result, stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a new subspecialty in medicine. One promising stem cell being investigated is the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC), which is obtained by genetically reprogramming mature cells to convert them into embryonic-like stem cells. These iPSCs are used to study the onset of disease, drug development, and medical therapies. However, functional studies on iPSCs involve the analysis of iPSC-derived colonies through manual identification, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and training-dependent. Thus, an automated instrument for the analysis of iPSC colonies is needed. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a novel technology to tackle this challenge. In particular, deep learning, a subfield of AI, offers an automated platform for analyzing iPSC colonies and other colony-forming stem cells. Deep learning rectifies data features using a convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of multi-layered neural network that can play an innovative role in image recognition. CNNs are able to distinguish cells with high accuracy based on morphologic and textural changes. Therefore, CNNs have the potential to create a future field of deep learning tasks aimed at solving various challenges in stem cell studies.

Hydrological time series data consists of nonlinear features and various time scales. With this view in mind, this study has combined the strengths of the Wavelet transformation, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to test a new method of a hybrid model for their ability to accurately predict future droughts. A 30-year rainfall data from the year 1986 to 2016 for Malaysia's Langat River Basin was analyzed. Meteorological drought indices (DI) such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standard Index of Annual Precipitation (SIAP) were used to compute historical drought events. At first, each of these computed drought time series went through a process of decomposition to be divided as low frequency and high-frequency sub-series by discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Secondly, the high and low-frequency sub-series were passed through the predictive model of ANN and ARIMA techniques, respectively. Lastly, the predicted sub-series were used to reconstruct and develop a final drought prediction model. It was found that the Wavelet-ARIMA-ANN (which named as W-2A) model outperformed the single ANN and wavelet-ANN predictive models. The ANN model developed by SPI achieved an overall correlation co-efficient R-value of 0.423, but the wavelet-based ANN model decreased in the R-value to 0.415. Finally, two different models, which were established using drought indices SPI and SIAP, and discrete wavelet transformation-based hybrid ANN-ARIMA (W-2A), have achieved improved R values of 0.914 and 0.934 respectively.","[Khan, Md Munir Hayet] INTI Int Univ INTI IU, Fac Engn & Quant Surveying, Nilai 71800, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia; [Khan, Md Munir Hayet; Muhammad, Nur Shazwani] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Civil Engn, Bandar Baru Bangi 43650, Malaysia; [El-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Khan, MMH (corresponding author), INTI Int Univ INTI IU, Fac Engn & Quant Surveying, Nilai 71800, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.; Khan, MMH (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Civil Engn, Bandar Baru Bangi 43650, Malaysia.",shihab.bd@gmail.com,"; El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014","Khan, Md.

AI has been applied to resources to improve skills giving teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability and drive performance. This paper, written for policymakers in the field of education, highlights the impact of AI and advancements in academic policy. These academic policymakers generate ideas and strategies for applying AI across various disciplines. There is also discussion around AI implementation in education throughout developing nations for moving towards and ensuring affordable, high-quality education for every individual. Education for sustainable development (ESD) aims to promote the development of knowledge, skills, understanding, values and actions necessary to build a sustainable world, to protect and preserve the environment, and promote social equity and economic sustainability. This paper analyses how AI can be used to update learning probabilities by providing examples of how it can be integrated with existing educational systems, using data to improve educational capital and quality in developing countries. It goes on to discuss whether policymakers and institutions can reinvent and rework educational programs to polish graduates' skills for the growing presence of AI across all disciplines. There are four main parts to this work: (1) different dimensions regarding the complexities and potential implications, (2) the pros and cons of educational sustainability policy related to AI, (3) carving out AI and its outstanding execution, and finally (4) the linkage of AI with higher education within the context of educational expansions.

The unmanageable and mushroom growth of industries and an exponential soar in population has made the ascent of air pollution intractable. To this end, the solutions that are based on the latest technologies, such as the Internet of things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are becoming increasingly popular and they have capabilities to monitor the extent and scale of air contaminants and would be subsequently useful for containing them. With centralized cloud-based IoT platforms, the ubiquitous and continuous monitoring of air quality and data processing can be facilitated for the identification of air pollution hot spots. However, owing to the inherent characteristics of cloud, such as large end-to-end delay and bandwidth constraint, handling the high velocity and large volume of data that are generated by distributed IoT sensors would not be feasible in the longer run. To address these issues, fog computing is a powerful paradigm, where the data are processed and filtered near the end of the IoT nodes and it is useful for improving the quality of service (QoS) of IoT network. To further improve the QoS, a conceptual model of distributed fog computing and a machine learning based data processing and analysis model is proposed for the optimal utilization of cloud resources. The proposed model provides a classification accuracy of 99% while using a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. This model is also simulated in iFogSim toolkit. It affords many advantages, such as reduced load on the central server by locally processing the data and reporting the quality of air. Additionally, it would offer the scalability of the system by integrating more air quality monitoring nodes in the IoT network.","[Ahmed, Mehreen; Mumtaz, Rafia; Zaidi, Syed Mohammad Hassan] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci SEECS, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Hafeez, Maryam] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Comp & Engn, Dept Engn & Technol, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Zaidi, Syed Ali Raza] Univ Leeds, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Leeds L2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Ahmad, Muneer] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Kaula Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Hafeez, M (corresponding author), Univ Huddersfield, Sch Comp & Engn, Dept Engn & Technol, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England.",mahmed.phdcs17seecs@seecs.edu.pk; rafia.mumtaz@seecs.edu.pk; drzaidi@seecs.edu.pk; m.hafeez@hud.ac.uk; s.a.zaidi@leeds.ac.uk; mmalik@um.edu.my,"Mumtaz, Rafia/O-7715-2016","Mumtaz, Rafia/0000-0002-0966-3957",,,,51,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,NOV,2020,9,11,,,,,,,1756,10.3390/electronics9111756,,,20,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,OW6OP,WOS:000593003900001,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

In this study, we proposed two approaches based on the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), namely, modification and hybridization. First, we attempted to solve the constraints of the original SCA by developing a modified SCA (MSCA) version with an improved identification capability of a random population using the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) technique. MSCA serves to guide SCA in obtaining a better local optimum in the exploitation phase with fast convergence based on an optimum value of the solution. Second, hybridization of the MSCA (HMSCA) and the Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) led to the development of the Hybrid Modified Sine Cosine Algorithm Cuckoo Search Algorithm (HMSCACSA) optimizer, which could search better optimal host nest locations in the global domain. Moreover, the HMSCACSA optimizer was validated over six classical test functions, the IEEE CEC 2017, and the IEEE CEC 2014 benchmark functions. The effectiveness of HMSCACSA was also compared with other hybrid metaheuristics such as the Particle Swarm Optimization-Grey Wolf Optimization (PSOGWO), Particle Swarm Optimization-Artificial Bee Colony (PSOABC), and Particle Swarm Optimization-Gravitational Search Algorithm (PSOGSA). In summary, the proposed HMSCACSA converged 63.89% faster and achieved a shorter Central Processing Unit (CPU) duration by a maximum of up to 43.6% compared to the other hybrid counterparts.","[Rosli, Siti Julia; Rahim, Hasliza A.; Abdul Rani, Khairul Najmy; Ngadiran, Ruzelita; Jusoh, Muzammil; Yasin, Mohd Najib Mohd; Sabapathy, Thennarasan; Andrew, Allan Melvin] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Ctr Excellence CoE, Adv Commun Engn, Kangar 01000, Perlis, Malaysia; [Rosli, Siti Julia; Rahim, Hasliza A.; Abdul Rani, Khairul Najmy; Ngadiran, Ruzelita; Ahmad, R.

This combination causes intensive gully erosion and land degradation. Therefore, we developed gully erosion susceptibility maps (GESMs) using the machine learning (ML) algorithms boosted regression tree (BRT), Bayesian additive regression tree (BART), support vector regression (SVR), and the ensemble of the SVR-Bee algorithm. The gully erosion inventory maps are based on a total of 178 gully head-cutting points, taken as the dependent factor, and gully erosion conditioning factors, which serve as the independent factors. We validated the ML model results using the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), true skill statistic (TSS), and Kappa coefficient index. The AUC result of the BRT, BART, SVR, and SVR-Bee models are 0.895, 0.902, 0.927, and 0.960, respectively, which show very good GESM accuracies.

In the tropical regions, rutting and fatigue cracking are major pavement distress affecting the serviceability of road infrastructure. Laboratory testing of the complex shear modulus and phase angle requires expensive and advanced equipment that is not obtainable in major laboratories within the developing countries of the region, giving rise to the need for an accurate predictive model to support quality pavement design. This research aims at developing a predictive model for the estimation of rutting and fatigue susceptive of asphalt binder at intermediate and high pavement temperatures. Asphalt rheological and ageing test was conducted on eight mixes of modified binders used to build the study database containing 1976 and 1668 data points for rutting and fatigue parameters respectively. The database was divided into training and simulation dataset. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithm was used to predict the rutting and fatigue parameters using unaged and aged conditioned inputs. The proposed GPR was compared with the support vector machine (SVM), recurrent neural networks (RNN) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Results show that the model performed better in the estimation of rutting parameter than the fatigue parameter. Further, unaged input variables show better reliability in the prediction of fatigue parameter.","[Uwanuakwa, Ikenna D.; Ali, Shaban Ismael Albrka; Akpinar, Pinar] Near East Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Mersin 10, TR-99138 Nicosia, Turkey; [Uwanuakwa, Ikenna D.; Hasan, Mohd Rosli Mohd; Sani, Ashiru] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Civil Engn, Engn Campus, Nibong Tebal 14300, Penang, Malaysia; [Sani, Ashiru] Kano Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Wudil 3011, Kano, Nigeria; [Shariff, Khairul Anuar] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Mat & Mineral Resources Engn, Engn Campus, Nibong Tebal 14300, Penang, Malaysia","Uwanuakwa, ID (corresponding author), Near East Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Mersin 10, TR-99138 Nicosia, Turkey.; Uwanuakwa, ID (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Civil Engn, Engn Campus, Nibong Tebal 14300, Penang, Malaysia.",ikenna.uwanuakwa@neu.edu.tr; shabanismael.albrka@neu.edu.tr; cerosli@usm.my; pinar.akpinar@neu.edu.tr; ashiru@student.usm.my; biokhairul@usm.my,"Sani, Ashiru/A-4104-2019; Uwanuakwa, Ikenna D./AAS-7892-2020; Shariff, Khairul Anuar/G-6625-2016","Sani, Ashiru/0000-0002-4525-072X; Uwanuakwa, Ikenna D./0000-0001-5546-0408; Shariff, Khairul Anuar/0000-0003-3331-2505; AKPINAR, PINAR/0000-0002-6885-8105","Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM)Universiti Sains Malaysia [304/PAWAM/60313048]; Ministry of Higher Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [203/PAWAM/6071358]",The research was funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) via Short-Term Research Grant Scheme (304/PAWAM/60313048) and the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (203/PAWAM/6071358).,,48,1,1,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

The use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) based on ICTs reduces the risk of accidents in the workplace, thanks to the capacity of the equipment to make decisions on the basis of environmental factors. Paradigms such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) make it possible to generate PPE models feasibly and create devices with more advanced characteristics such as monitoring, sensing the environment and risk detection between others. The working environment is monitored continuously by these models and they notify the employees and their supervisors of any anomalies and threats. This paper presents a smart helmet prototype that monitors the conditions in the workers' environment and performs a near real-time evaluation of risks. The data collected by sensors is sent to an AI-driven platform for analysis. The training dataset consisted of 11,755 samples and 12 different scenarios. As part of this research, a comparative study of the state-of-the-art models of supervised learning is carried out. Moreover, the use of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is proposed for the detection of possible occupational risks. The data are processed to make them suitable for the CNN and the results are compared against a Static Neural Network (NN), Naive Bayes Classifier (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), where the CNN had an accuracy of 92.05% in cross-validation.","[Campero-Jurado, Israel] Lab Informat Parallelisme, 46 Allee Italie, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Marquez-Sanchez, Sergio; Rodriguez, Sara; Corchado, Juan M.] Univ Salamanca, BISITE Res Grp, Calle Espejo S-N Edificio Multiusos IDi, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Quintanar-Gomez, Juan] Univ Politecn Pachuca, Grad Sch Informat Technol & Commun, Res Dept, Zempoala 43830, Hidalgo, Mexico; [Corchado, Juan M.] IoT Digital Innovat Hub Spain, Air Inst, Salamanca 37188, Spain; [Corchado, Juan M.] Osaka Inst Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Elect Informat & Commun, Osaka 5358585, Japan; [Corchado, Juan M.] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Creat Technol & Heritage, Locked Bag 01, Bachok 16300, Kelantan, Malaysia","Marquez-Sanchez, S (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, BISITE Res Grp, Calle Espejo S-N Edificio Multiusos IDi, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",israel.campero_jurado@ens-lyon.fr; smarquez@usal.es; juanquintanargomez@micorreo.upp.edu.mx; srg@usal.es; corchado@usal.es,"Corchado, Juan M/D-3229-2013; Marquez Sanchez, Sergio/Y-9639-2018","Corchado, Juan M/0000-0002-2829-1829; Marquez Sanchez, Sergio/0000-0003-0434-6538","Research group in Bioinformatics, Intelligent Computer Systems and Educational Technology (BISITE), R&B building, Salamanca, Spain","This research was funded by Research group in Bioinformatics, Intelligent Computer Systems and Educational Technology (BISITE), R&B building, Calle Espejo s/n, 37008, Salamanca, Spain.",,75,0,0,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,NOV,2020,20,21,,,,,,,6241,10.3390/s20216241,,,27,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,OR1GK,WOS:000589224500001,33139608,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,11/3/2021

We have developed a new ensemble learning model that predicts flash flood susceptibility at Haraz, Iran. The new model couples a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model with an extreme learning machine (ELM) and backpropagation (BP) structure optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) named GA-BN-NN model. We applied the support vector machine (SVM) technique to a database of 194 flood locations with ten conditioning factors. An artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm with a multilayer perceptron function, MLP-BP, optimized by a genetic algorithm, GA-MLP, and a shuffled frog-leaping algorithm, SFLA-MLP, were used as benchmark models for assessing the power prediction of the proposed model. Statistical measures, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-measure and Jaccard coefficient, and root mean square error, were used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, respectively, of the training and testing datasets. We found that all ten factors are positively correlated with flood occurrence, but slope angle has the highest average merit (AM=9.7) and thus contributes most to the occurrence of flooding. Results indicate that the GA-BN-NN model has the highest goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy (AUC=0.966) and hence outperforms other ensemble learning models that we tested - the SFLA-MLP, MLP-BP, and GA-MLP models. We thus conclude that the proposed model is a promising technique for managing risk in flood-prone areas around the world.","[Shirzadi, Ataollah] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Sanandaj, Iran; [Asadi, Shahrokh; Ronoud, Somayeh] Univ Tehran, Coll Farabi, Dept Engn, Data Min Lab, Tehran, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Kurdistan Studies Inst, Dept Zrebar Lake Environm Res, Sanandaj, Iran; [Clague, John J.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 8888 Univ Dr Burnaby, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Khosravi, Khabat] Sari Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ, Dept Watershed Management Engn, Sari, Iran; [Binh Thai Pham] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Ahmad, Baharin Bin] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Dieu Tien Bui] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Dieu Tien Bui] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Bui, DT (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",buitiendieu@tdtu.edu.vn,"Khosravi, Khabat/M-1073-2017; Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017","Khosravi, Khabat/0000-0001-5773-4003; Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0003-1666-1180",Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) [96004000]; GIS research group (Ton Duc Thang University) via the research project GIS-based applications for solving real-world problems'',We greatly appreciate the editor and anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that helped us to improve the paper.

Determining UCS values in laboratory is costly and time consuming, hence, its indirect determination through use of rock index tests is of a great interest and advantage. This study presents a prediction process of the UCS values through the use of three non-destructive tests i.e., p-wave velocity, Schmidt hammer and density. This process was done by developing an intelligent predictive technique namely the group method of data handling (GMDH). Before constructing intelligence system, a series of experimental equations were proposed using three non-destructive tests. The results showed that there is a need to propose new model with taking advantages of all three non-destructive tests results. Then, several GMDH models were built through the use of various parametric studies on the most effective GMDH factors. For comparison purposes, an artificial neural network (ANN) was also modelled to predict rock strength. The obtained results of the ANN and GMDH were assessed based on system error and coefficient of determination values. The results confirmed that the proposed GMDH model is an applicable, powerful, and practical intelligence system that is able to provide an acceptable accuracy level for predicting rock strength.","[Li, Diyuan; Zhou, Jian] Cent South Univ, Sch Resources & Safety Engn, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Armaghani, Danial Jahed; Lai, Sai Hin] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Hasanipanah, Mahdi] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam","Armaghani, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.; Hasanipanah, M (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.",diyuan.li@csu.edu.cn; danialarmaghani@um.edu.my; csujzhou@hotmail.com; laish@um.edu.my; hasanipanahmahdi@duytan.edu.vn,"Zhou, Jian/M-2461-2018","Zhou, Jian/0000-0003-4769-4487",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1934211],The first author would like to acknowledge the financial support from the Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1934211).,,77,2,2,5,5,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0195-9298,1573-4862,,J NONDESTRUCT EVAL,J.

The accurate prediction of water quality index is an essential requisite for water quality management, human health, public consumption, and domestic uses. A comprehensive review as an initial attempt is conducted on existing solutions through data-driven models. In addition, the ensemble Kalman filter is found to be a suitable data assimilation method, which is successfully applied in hydrological variables modeling and other complexes, nonlinear, and chaotic problems. In this study, a new application of ensemble Kalman filter-artificial neural network is proposed to predict water quality index using physicochemical parameters for two commonly pollutant rivers, namely Klang and Langat, in Malaysia. As a further attempt, in order to improve the models' performance, a new preprocessing technique is adopted as the newly constructed assimilated model. The results confirm that ensemble hybrid based intrinsic time-scale decomposition has reduced root mean square error by 24% for Klang and 34% for Langat, respectively, compared with the intrinsic time-scale decomposition-conventional neural network model.

Knowledge based methods employing rule bases techniques are found vast applications in geoscience studies. These methods are applicable for petroleum reservoir geological modelling and characterizations, specifically for geologically complex structures. In this study, we present a knowledge based seismic acoustic impedance inversion method which employs rule based method for porosity estimation. The back propagation algorithm and the fuzzy neural network are also used in the methodology for parameter optimization and definition of nonlinear relationship between seismic attributes and porosity of the reservoir rock. The methodology initiates by seismic acoustic impedance inversion, followed by conventional porosity estimation. Subsequently, a knowledgebase was designed by investigation on more than 24 published case studies. This knowledgebase was used for definition of rules and optimization number of rules and improve efficiency of the inference engine. The porosity model obtained by conventional method in previous step would be used for primary evaluation of the rules. The extracted rules and optimized number rules then would be used for rule-based porosity estimation. The methodology was applied on a petroleum field containing two heterogeneous reservoir formations. Result of application of the proposed approach was evaluated with core analysis, thin sections and drilling data.

The traditional methods for evaporation prediction could encounter numerous obstacles owing to the effect of several parameters on the shape of the evaporation pattern. The current research presented modern model called the Coactive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (CANFIS). Modification for such model has been achieved for enhancing the evaporation prediction accuracy. Genetic algorithm was utilized to select the effective input combination. The efficiency of the proposed model has been compared with popular artificial intelligence models according to several statistical indicators. Two different case studies Aswan High Dam (AHD) and Timah Tasoh Dam (TTD) have been considered to explore the performance of the proposed models. It is concluded that the modified GA-CANFIS model is better than GA-ANFIS, GA-SVR, and GA-RBFNN for evaporation prediction for both case studies. GA-CANFIS attained minimum RMSE (15.22 mm month(-1)for AHD, 8.78 mm month(-1)for TTD), minimum MAE (12.48 mm month(-1)for AHD, 5.11 mm month(-1)for TTD), and maximum determination coefficient (0.98 for AHD, 0.95 for TTD).","[Allawi, Mohammed Falah] Minist Water Resources, State Commiss Dams & Reservoirs, Baghdad, Iraq; [Aidan, Ibraheem Abdallah] AlMaarif Univ Coll, Dept Civil Engn, Ramadi, Anbar, Iraq; [El-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Allawi, MF (corresponding author), Minist Water Resources, State Commiss Dams & Reservoirs, Baghdad, Iraq.",mohmmd.falah@gmail.com,,,,,,36,1,1,2,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

So this problem is divided into two major tasks the first of which is the Classification of Archaeological Fragments into similar groups (CAF) and the second one is the Reconstruction of each group into the original Archaeological Objects (RAO). To solve this problem, a method has been proposed, which exploits the color and texture properties of the surfaces of the fragments. Furthermore, the reconstruction of archaeological fragments in 3D geometry is an important problem in pattern recognition. Therefore, this research has implemented the algorithms to reconstruct real datasets using Neural Networks. The challenge of this work is to reconstruct the objects without previous knowledge about the part that should start the assembly; this greatly helps to avoid the presence of gaps created due to missing artifact fragments. The study utilizes the geometric features of the fragments as important features to reconstruct the objects by classifying their fragments using a Neural Network model. (C) 2018 The Authors.

In order to daily usage of PHEVs, daytime charging stations are required and at this point, only an appropriate charging control and a management of the infrastructure can lead to wider employment of PHEVs. In this study, four swarm intelligence based optimization techniques: particle swarm optimization (PSO), gravitational search algorithm (GSA), accelerated particle swarm optimization, and hybrid version of PSO and GSA (PSOGSA) have been applied for the state-of-charge optimization of PHEVs.

These nitrogenous compounds are mainly responsible for eutrophication when present in river water, and for 'blue baby syndrome' when present in drinking water. High concentrations of these compounds in rivers may eventually lead to the closure of treatment plants. This study presents a training and a selection approach to develop an optimum artificial neural network model for predicting monthly average nitrate-N and monthly average ammonia-N. Several studies have predicted these compounds, but most of the proposed procedures do not involve testing various model architectures in order to achieve the optimum predicting model. Additionally, none of the models have been trained for hydrological conditions such as the case of Malaysia. This study presents models trained on the hydrological data from 1981 to 2017 for the Langat River in Selangor, Malaysia. The model architectures used for training are General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Multilayer Neural Network and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). These models were trained for various combinations of internal parameters, input variables and model architectures. Post-training, the optimum performing model was selected based on the regression and error values and plot of predicted versus observed values. Optimum models provide promising results with a minimum overall regression value of 0.92.","[Kumar, Pavitra; Lai, Sai Hin; Mohd, Nuruol Syuhadaa; El-shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Kamal, Md Rowshon] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Seri Kembangan, Selangor, Malaysia; [Afan, Haitham Abdulmohsin] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang, Vietnam; [Ahmed, Ali Najah] Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Energy Infrastruct IEI, Kajang, Selangor, Malaysia; [Sherif, Mohsen; Sefelnasr, Ahmed] United Arab Emirates Univ, Natl Water & Energy Ctr, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Sherif, Mohsen] United Arab Emirates Univ, Coll Engn, Civil & Environm Eng Dept, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","El-shafie, A (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",elshafie@um.edu.my,"MOHD, NURUOL SYUHADAA/B-9443-2010; El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014","Kumar, Pavitra/0000-0002-4683-724X; El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505","University of Malaya Research Grant [RP025A-18SUS, GPF031A-2019]",Professor Ahmed El-Shafie RP025A-18SUS University of Malaya Research Grant um. edu.my Professor El-shafie acted as a supervisor for this research work and also had role in planning the methodology of this research work.

Coupled with other analysis such as X-ray diffraction, fractional free volume, and radial distribution function, structural and separation features like glass-transition temperature, mean square displacement, density, and adsorption isotherms define the solution-diffusion separation mechanism. Two state-of-the-art and accurate artificial intelligence (AI) models, viz ant colony optimization-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ACO-ANFIS) and genetic programming (GP) are developed to estimate the permeability of mentioned gas molecules within the MMMs. The R-2 value for ACO-ANFIS and GP was obtained as 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. The mean squared error value for ACO-ANFIS and GP was obtained as 0.41 and 0.51, respectively. Although the accuracy of ACO-ANFIS is higher, both models can be regarded as efficient models. The findings of the study demonstrate that the AI models are accurate. In addition, the effects of various key parameters like zeolite and pNA loading and kinetic diameter of gases are investigated.

One is a machine learning approach, known as 'Cascaded Object Detector' (COD) and the other is a composition of traditional customised methods, individually known as 'Colour Transformation': 'Colour Segmentation' and 'Circular Hough Transformation'. The (Viola-Jones) COD generates 'histogram of oriented gradient' (HOG) features to detect tomatoes. For ripeness checking, the RGB mean is calculated with a set of rules. However, for traditional methods, colour thresholding is applied to detect tomatoes either from natural or solid background and RGB colour is adjusted to identify ripened tomatoes.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are the Artificial Intelligence techniques that have been attracting interest due to their flexibility to account for various data patterns. Both are black-box models which are sensitive to hyperparameter settings. Feature selection can be performed on SVM to enable explanation with the reduced features, whereas feature importance computed by RF can be used for model explanation. The benefits of accuracy and interpretation allow for significant improvement in the area of credit risk and credit scoring. This paper proposes the use of Harmony Search (HS), to form a hybrid HS-SVM to perform feature selection and hyperparameter tuning simultaneously, and a hybrid HS-RF to tune the hyperparameters. A Modified HS (MHS) is also proposed with the main objective to achieve comparable results as the standard HS with a shorter computational time. MHS consists of four main modifications in the standard HS: (i) Elitism selection during memory consideration instead of random selection, (ii) dynamic exploration and exploitation operators in place of the original static operators, (iii) a self-adjusted bandwidth operator, and (iv) inclusion of additional termination criteria to reach faster convergence. Along with parallel computing, MHS effectively reduces the computational time of the proposed hybrid models. The proposed hybrid models are compared with standard statistical models across three different datasets commonly used in credit scoring studies. The computational results show that MHS-RF is most robust in terms of model performance, model explainability and computational time.","[Goh, Rui Ying; Lee, Lai Soon; Gopal, Kathiresan] Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Math Res, Lab Computat Stat & Operat Res, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Lee, Lai Soon] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Seow, Hsin-Vonn] Univ Nottingham Malaysia, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Semenyih 43500, Selangor, Malaysia","Lee, LS (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Math Res, Lab Computat Stat & Operat Res, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.; Lee, LS (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",gr.ying@hotmail.com; lls@upm.edu.my; Hsin-Vonn.Seow@nottingham.edu.my; kathiresan@upm.edu.my,"; Gopal, Kathiresan/P-6345-2018","Seow, Hsin-Vonn/0000-0002-6877-8498; Lee, Lai Soon/0000-0002-6270-1414; Gopal, Kathiresan/0000-0001-5302-8179",Geran Putra-Inisiatif Putra Siswazah [GP-IPS/2018/9646000],This research was funded by Geran Putra-Inisiatif Putra Siswazah (GP-IPS/2018/9646000) (Universiti Putra Malaysia).,,38,1,1,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1099-4300,,ENTROPY-SWITZ,Entropy,SEP,2020,22,9,,,,,,,989,10.3390/e22090989,,,25,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",Physics,OE7CQ,WOS:000580684700001,33286758,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,11/3/2021

However, the FER's critical problem with traditional local binary pattern (LBP) is the loss of neighboring pixels related to different scales that can affect the texture of facial images. To overcome such limitations, this study describes a new extended LBP method to extract feature vectors from images, detecting each image from facial expressions. The proposed method is based on the bitwise AND operation of two rotational kernels applied on LBP(8,1) and LBP(8,2) and utilizes two accessible datasets. Firstly, the facial parts are detected and the essential components of a face are observed, such as eyes, nose, and lips. The portion of the face is then cropped to reduce the dimensions and an unsharp masking kernel is applied to sharpen the image. The filtered images then go through the feature extraction method and wait for the classification process. Four machine learning classifiers were used to verify the proposed method. This study shows that the proposed multi-scale featured local binary pattern (MSFLBP), together with Support Vector Machine (SVM), outperformed the recent LBP-based state-of-the-art approaches resulting in an accuracy of 99.12% for the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) dataset and 89.08% for the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) dataset.","[Yasmin, Suraiya] Int Islamic Univ Chittagong, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chittagong 4318, Bangladesh; [Pathan, Refat Khan; Biswas, Munmun] BGC Trust Univ Bangladesh, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chittagong 4381, Bangladesh; [Khandaker, Mayeen Uddin] Sunway Univ, Ctr Biomed Phys, Sch Healthcare & Med Sci, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor, Malaysia; [Faruque, Mohammad Rashed Iqbal] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Space Sci Ctr ANGKASA, Inst Climate Change IPI, UKM, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia","Khandaker, MU (corresponding author), Sunway Univ, Ctr Biomed Phys, Sch Healthcare & Med Sci, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor, Malaysia.",suraiyabrishti@gmail.com; refatkhan93@gmail.com; munmun@bgctub.ac.bd; mayeenk@sunway.edu.my; rashed@ukm.edu.my,"Khandaker, Mayeen Uddin/F-5376-2011; Faruque, Mohammad Rashed Iqbal/D-1840-2013","Khandaker, Mayeen Uddin/0000-0003-3772-294X; Khan Pathan, Refat/0000-0002-3773-0950; Faruque, Mohammad Rashed Iqbal/0000-0003-4086-7672","Research Universiti Grant, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dana Impak Perdana (DIP) [2020-018]","This work was supported by the Research Universiti Grant, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dana Impak Perdana (DIP), code: 2020-018.",,36,1,1,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,SEP,2020,20,18,,,,,,,5391,10.3390/s20185391,,,17,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,OE8XZ,WOS:000580807800001,32967087,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,11/3/2021

Early and accurate prediction of Ozone is very significant for efficient monitoring of pollution towards constituting advanced early alarm systems. In this study, wavelet transform (WT) approach was applied to handle input variables prior to introduce them to artificial neural network (ANN). This approach attempts to remove the noise impacts which decreases the accuracy of simulation processes. Additionally, to improve ANN model performance, the selection of suitable type of transfer function with effective input combinations was thoroughly investigated before introducing the WT approach. The hybrid model (W-ANN) was also compared to the classical ANN in the prediction of 1 h ahead Ozone concentrations to insure the significance of this study. Based on statistical measures during all phases (i.e. training, validation, and testing), the W-ANN outperformed ANN model. The W-ANN model yielded fewer values of root mean square error (0.9313 ppm) and mean absolute error (0.6531 ppm) while, ANN model produced higher values of root mean square error (2.902 ppm) and mean absolute error (1.991 ppm) during the testing set. The quantity of predicted values that have absolute relative error between 1 and 3% represented 18% and 36.16% of all data points for each approach, ANN and W-ANN respectively. Additionally, the hybrid W-ANN managed successfully to forecast multiple time scales (2-, 3-, 4 and 5- ahead hour Ozone concentrations) and reported very fewer errors in comparison with modeling of one hour ahead Ozone gas concentration.","[AlOmar, Mohamed Khalid; Hameed, Mohammed] Al Maaref Univ Coll, Dept Civil Engn, Ramadi, Iraq; [AlSaadi, Mohammed Abdulhakim] Univ Nizwa, Natl Chair Mat Sci & Met, Nizwa, Oman; [AlSaadi, Mohammed Abdulhakim] Univ Malaya, Nanotechnol & Catalysis Res Ctr NANOCAT, IPS Bldg, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","AlOmar, MK (corresponding author), Al Maaref Univ Coll, Dept Civil Engn, Ramadi, Iraq.",mohd.alomar@yahoo.com,"Hameed, Mohammed Majeed/E-6577-2019; AlSaadi, Mohammed/ABG-7333-2020","Hameed, Mohammed Majeed/0000-0002-9366-9162; AlSaadi, Mohammed/0000-0001-9278-6490",AlMaarif University College,The authors would like to express their thanks to AlMaarif University College for funding this research.,,50,3,3,1,1,TURKISH NATL COMMITTEE AIR POLLUTION RES & CONTROL-TUNCAP,BUCA,"DOKUZ EYLUL UNIV, DEPT ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, TINAZTEPE CAMPUS, BUCA, IZMIR 35160, TURKEY",1309-1042,,,ATMOS POLLUT RES,Atmos.

Fluctuation refers to population diversity which can be measured using dimension-wise diversity. This paper performed component-wise analysis of ABC algorithm using diversity measurement. The analysis revealed scout bees component as counterproductive and onlooker bees component with poor global search ability. Subsequently, an ABC algorithm without scout bees component and modified onlooker bees component is proposed in this paper. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ScoutlessABC is validated on test suite of a dozen of benchmark functions. To further evaluate the performance, ScoutlessABC is employed on the parameter training problem of fuzzy neural network for solving eight classification problems. The experimental results show that ScoutlessABC maintains strong convergence ability than the original ABC algorithm. Overall, this study has two major contributions: (a) an effective component-wise analysis approach using diversity measurement and (b) a simplified and modified ABC variant with enhanced search efficiency.

Well logs are continuous records of several physical properties of drilled rocks that can be related to different lithologies by experienced log analysts. This work is time consuming and likely to be imperfect because human analysis is subjective. Thus, any automated classification approach with high promptness and accuracy is very welcome by log analysts. One of the crucial requirements in petroleum engineering is to interpret a bed's lithology, which can be done by grouping a formation into electrofacies. In the past, geophysical modelling, petro-physical analysis, artificial intelligence and several statistical method approaches have been implemented to interpret lithology. In this research, important well log features are selected by using the Extra Tree Classifier (ETC), and then five individual electrofacies are constructed by using the selected well log features. Finally, a rough set theory (RST)-based whitebox classification approach is proposed to classify the electrofacies by generating decision rules. These rules are later on used to determine the lithology classes and we found that RST is beneficial for performing data mining tasks such as data classification and rule extraction from uncertain and vague well log datasets. A comparison study is also provided, where we use support vector machine (SVM), deep learning based on feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) and random forest classifier (RFC) to compare the electrofacies classification accuracy.","[Hossain, Touhid Mohammad; Aziz, Izzatdin A.] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Fac Informat & Fundamental Sciencies, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Watada, Junzo] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Informat Prod & Syst, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8080135, Japan; [Hermana, Maman] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Fac Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Geosci, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia","Hossain, TM (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Fac Informat & Fundamental Sciencies, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.",touhidmhossain@gmail.com; junzo.watada@gmail.com; izzatdin@utp.edu.my; maman.hermana@utp.edu.my,"Hermana, Maman/ABG-4094-2020","Hossain, Touhid Mohammad/0000-0003-3457-7388; Hermana, Maman/0000-0002-0205-4446",Petroleum Research Fund (PRF)American Chemical Society [0153AB-A33],"This research is supported by Petroleum Research Fund (PRF), Cost Center 0153AB-A33, under the leadership of Dr. Eswaran Padmanabhan.",,51,1,1,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Generally, in artificial intelligence optimization, the particles follow a local or global best particle until finding an acceptable solution. In well- developed optimization techniques, such as swarm optimization (PSO) and the firefly algorithm (FA), getting around the initial optimal value of the group and randomly checking the effect of the surrounding points may lead to a better solution than the initial optimal value. The present work was inspired by the fascinating movement of Garra Rufa fish between two immersed legs during a regular fish massage session. A new optimization approach is proposed and modeled based on the movements of Garra Rufa fish, in which the particles are separated into groups, and the best optimal value leads each group for the group. Also, some of these particles are allowed to change groups depending on the fitness of the leaders of the groups. The suggested strategy is then compared with PSO and FA using multiple test optimization functions, such as the Ackley, Hartmann, Michalewicz, Shubert, Easom, Bohachevsky, and Rastrigin functions. Also, a multiobjective real issue in power system is tested using the proposed methods where the objectives were cumulative voltage deviation and power losses of three weight sets during the selection allocation of distribution generators.

In this study, the adaptive fuzzy interface system (ANFIS), support vector machines (SVMs), and artificial neural network (ANN) models were employed for predicting the total dissolved solids of aquifers. The moth flam optimization, cat swarm optimization (CSO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), shark algorithm (SA), grey wolf optimization (GWO), and gravitational search algorithm (GSA) were used to train the ANFIS, SVM, and ANN models. The data were collected from Yazd plain (Iran) to predict the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). The principal component analysis was used to determine the most appropriate inputs for predicting TDS. The hybrid ANFIS-MFO improved the accuracy of RMSE (roo mean square error) over the ANN-MFO and SVM-MFO models by 1.4% and 3.8%, respectively. It was also observed that the SVM model had the least NSE (Nash Sutcliffe efficiency) value among all the models. Unlike the standalone ANFIS, the multilayer perceptron (MLP), and SVMs models, the hybrid ANFIS, ANN, and SVM demonstrated high accuracy in the training and testing phase, so that in the optimal hybrid model, ANFIS-MFO, values of mean absolute error (MAE), Nash Sutcliff efficiency (NSE), and percent bias (PBIAS) were 2.21 (mg/lit), 0.94, 0.15, 2.981 (mg/lit), 0.93, and 0.18, respectively. The ANFIS-MFO was also seen to further enhance the RMSE by approximately 3% and 7%, as compared to the ANN-MFO and SVM-MFO. This study also aims to investigate the temporal variability TDS using innovative trend analysis (ITA). The TDS value of < 1800 (mg/lit) indicates a decreasing trend, while a medium TDS value (2000 mg/lit < TDS < 2800 mg/lit) does not have a significant trend. The high TDS values (TDS > 3000 mg/lit) indicate an increasing trend.

We envision that 5G NS can emerge as a game changer that accelerates the development of FMC while counterintuitively opening up opportunities for fixed operators and the like in need of higher access network capability by leveraging NS-assisted FMC. In this article, we present an architectural framework to foster cross-industry infrastructure collaboration from a RAN slicing perspective with the aim of reducing network costs and improving rollout efficiency in the broadband ecosystem. Under this framework, RAN slicing can turn wireless access into an anchor service offering that can be exploited by not only existing mobile operators with licensed spectrum, but by a host of slice tenants including fixed wireless access startups, digital subscriber line operators, and converged operators. In the latter instances, independent RAN slices can be instantiated and granularly scaled to support these tenants who may not own mobile infrastructure or spectrum, while maximizing reuse of their live networks. Following a discussion on the market drivers and rationales for RAN slicing, we outline some RAN slicing options for different operators to realize resource isolation and allocation. Furthermore, a big data-driven, artificial-intelligence- powered RAN slicing and resource management framework is introduced for enabling RAN automation. Finally, several future challenges are identified.","[Chuah, Teong Chee] Multimedia Univ, Cyberjaya, Malaysia; [Lee, Ying Loong] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman UTAR, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia","Chuah, TC (corresponding author), Multimedia Univ, Cyberjaya, Malaysia.",,"Lee, Ying Loong/ABI-3844-2020","Lee, Ying Loong/0000-0002-0841-449X","Ministry of Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/MMU/01/1]; Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Research Fund (UTARRF) [IPSR/RMC/UTARRF/2018-C2/L02]","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Education Malaysia under Grant FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/MMU/01/1, and in part by the Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Research Fund (UTARRF) under Grant IPSR/RMC/UTARRF/2018-C2/L02.",,15,0,0,1,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0163-6804,1558-1896,,IEEE COMMUN MAG,IEEE Commun.

To overcome the above-mentioned issues, the researchers around the world have tried and tested different control methods among which the computational intelligence (CI) based methods have been found as most effective in mitigating the power quality and transient response problems intuitively. The significance of the mentioned optimization approaches in contemporary ac Microgrid (MG) controls can be observed from the increasing number of published articles and book chapters in the recent past. However, literature related to this important subject is scattered with no comprehensive review that provides detailed insight information on this substantial development. As such, this research work provides a detailed overview of four of the most extensively used CI-based optimization techniques, namely, artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and genetic algorithm (GA) as applied in ac MG controls from 42 research articles along with their basic working mechanism, merits, and limitations. Due to space and scope constraints, this study excludes the applications of swarm intelligence-based optimization methods in the studied field of research. Each of the mentioned CI algorithms is explored for three major MG control applications i.e., reactive power compensation and power quality, MPPT and MG's voltage, frequency, and power regulation. In addition, this work provides a classification of the mentioned CI-based optimization studies based on various categories such as key study objective, optimization method applied, DGs utilized, studied MG operating mode, and considered operating conditions in order to ease the searchability and selectivity of the articles for the readers. Hence, it is envisaged that this comprehensive review will provide a valuable one-stop source of knowledge to the researchers working in the field of CI-based ac MG control architectures.","[Jumani, Touqeer Ahmed; Mustafa, Mohd Wazir; Rasid, Madihah Md] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Elect Engn, Skudai 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia; [Jumani, Touqeer Ahmed] Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, SZAB Campus, Khairpur Mirs 66020, Pakistan; [Hamadneh, Nawaf N.] Saudi Elect Univ, Coll Sci & Theoret Studies, Dept Basic Sci, Riyadh 11673, Saudi Arabia; [Atawneh, Samer H.] Saudi Elect Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Riyadh 11673, Saudi Arabia; [Mirjat, Nayyar Hussain] Mehran UET, Dept Elect Engn, Jamshoro 76020, Pakistan; [Bhayo, Muhammad Akram] Quaid E Awan UEST, Dept Elect Engn, Shaheed Benazirabad 67480, Pakistan; [Khan, Ilyas] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Math & Stat, Ho Chi Minh City 72915, Vietnam","Khan, I (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Math & Stat, Ho Chi Minh City 72915, Vietnam.",atouqeer2@graduate.utm.my; wazir@fke.utm.my; nhamadneh@seu.edu.sa; satawneh@seu.edu.sa; madihah@fke.utm.my; nayyar.hussain@faculty.muetedu.pk; bhayoakram@gmail.com; ilyaskhan@tdtu.edu.vn,"Khan, Ilyas/C-8770-2019","Khan, Ilyas/0000-0002-2056-9371; Hamadneh, Nawaf/0000-0002-2170-2074; Jumani, Touqeer/0000-0002-5201-5111",,,,98,1,1,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,AUG,2020,13,16,,,,,,,4063,10.3390/en13164063,,,22,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,NH5PA,WOS:000564720600001,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

FOPID contains five tuning parameters as compared to three in the conventional PID controller. The additional tuning knobs in FOPID provide increased control flex-ibility and precise control action, however, their inclusion makes the tuning process more complex and tedious. Thus, the intelligence of an artificial intelligence (AI) technique called jaya optimiza-tion algorithm (JOA) is utilized in order to obtain an optimal combination of FOPID gains which further led to the optimal transient response and improved stability of the considered AVR system. To validate the performance superiority of the proposed approach its corresponding system's dynamic response is compared with that of the other well-known AI-based approaches explored in recent literature. Furthermore, the stability study of the proposed AVR system is carried out by evaluating its pole/zero and bode maps. Finally, the robustness of the proposed optimized AVR system against the system's parameter variation is evaluated by varying the time constants of all the four components of AVR (generator, exciter, amplifier and sensor) from-50% to +50% independently. The proposed algorithm based FOPID tuning technique provides 59.82%, 56.09%, 14.94%, 34.24%, 35.70%, 21.64%, 12.0%, 41.33%, 14.84% and 15.17% reduced over-shoot than that of differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Bibliography Based Optimization (BBO), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), Pattern Search Algorithm (PSA), Improved Kidney Inspired Algorithm (IKA), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) and Local Unimodal Sampling (LUS) algorithm respectively, thus validates its competence and effectiveness.

This study presents a hybrid method combining machine learning methods with persistent homology to improve the prediction performance. Three stock prices namely Kuala Lumpur Composite Index, Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Industrial and Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Technology sampled from Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange are selected for experimental evaluation. In particular, persistent homology was applied to obtain a new and useful input vectors of invariant topological features from returns of these stock prices for further classification task using machine learning methods such as logistic regression, artificial neural network, support vector machine and random forest to predict the next day movement direction of Kuala Lumpur Composite Index. For comparative analysis, we compare the proposed method with others, where the machine learning methods are applied independently on stock returns and also on technical indicators respectively. By using the average of prediction performances and pairwise model comparison method, these two evaluation measures revealed that machine learning methods with persistent homology produced better prediction performance. Our results also demonstrated that the combination of support vector machine with persistent homology generates the best outcome.

This study proposes a clinical computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using CT features to automatically discriminate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Methods Overall, 612 patients (306 COVID-19 and 306 non-COVID-19 pneumonia) were recruited. Twenty radiological features were extracted from CT images to evaluate the pattern, location, and distribution of lesions of patients in both groups. All significant CT features were fed in five classifiers namely decision tree,K-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, support vector machine, and ensemble to evaluate the best performing CAD system in classifying COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. Results Location and distribution pattern of involvement, number of the lesion, ground-glass opacity (GGO) and crazy-paving, consolidation, reticular, bronchial wall thickening, nodule, air bronchogram, cavity, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and lymphadenopathy are the significant features to classify COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups. Our proposed CAD system obtained the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.965, 93.54%, 90.32%, and 91.94%, respectively, using ensemble (COVIDiag) classifier. Conclusions This study proposed a COVIDiag model obtained promising results using CT radiological routine features.

Thus, this study proposes a new approach for intrusion detection that is implemented using an enhanced Bat algorithm (EBat) for training an artificial neural network. The goal of the current study is to increase the accuracy of the classification for malicious and un-malicious network traffic. The proposed study herein includes a comparison with nine other metaheuristic algorithms (conventional and new algorithms) that are used to evaluate the new approach alongside the related works. Firstly, the EBat algorithm was developed and used to select suitable weights and biases. Next, the neural network was employed using the found optimal weights and biases to realize the intrusion detection approach. Four types of intrusion detection evaluation datasets were used to compare the proposed approach against the other algorithms. The findings revealed that the proposed method outperformed the other nine classification algorithms and it is unparalleled for the network intrusion detection.","[Ghanem, Waheed A. H.

In the present study, back propagation neural network (BPNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector regression (SVR), and one multilinear regression (MLR) are considered for the prediction of water quality index (WQI) at three stations, namely Nizamuddin, Palla, and Udi (Chambal), across the Yamuna River, India. The nonlinear ensemble technique was proposed using the neural network ensemble (NNE) approach to improve the performance accuracy of the single models. The observed WQ parameters were provided by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) including dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, biological oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia (NH3), temperature (T), and WQI. The performance of the models was evaluated by various statistical indices. The obtained results indicated the feasibility of the developed data intelligence models for predicting the WQI at the three stations with the superior modelling results of the NNE. The results also showed that the minimum values for root mean square (RMS) varied between 0.1213 and 0.4107, 0.003 and 0.0367, and 0.002 and 0.0272 for Nizamuddin, Palla, and Udi (Chambal), respectively.

Soil erosion and mass movement which induce landslides have become one of the disasters faced in Selangor, Malaysia causing enormous loss affecting human lives, destruction of property and the environment. Establishing and maintaining slope stability using mechanical structures are costly. Hence, biotechnical slope protection offers an alternative which is not only cost effective but also aesthetically pleasing. To reach the aim of the current study, a field investigations and numerical studies were conducted and a suitable database was prepared and established. By preparing factor of safety (FOS) as a single output parameter and a combination of the most important parameters on that, the desired models have been designed based on training and test patterns. In order to evaluate and compare the prediction precision of the developed models, a series of statistical indices, such as root mean squared error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R-square) and variance account for (VAF) are calculated. Many intelligence models with the most effective parameters on the mentioned models were developed to predict FOS. Based on the simulation results and the measured indices, it was found that the proposed neuro-fuzzy model with the lowest system error and highest R-square performs better as compared to other proposed ANN and neuro-bee models. Therefore, the neuro-fuzzy can provide a new applicable model to effectively predict the FOS of the slopes due to the fact that it is able to combine the advantages of the ANN and fuzzy inference system to indicate a high prediction capacity in solving problem of slope stability.

Various studies have suggested that the prevalence of voice disorders in the general population is greater than 10%. An automatic diagnosis for voice disorders via machine learning algorithms is desired to reduce the cost and time needed for examination by doctors and speech-language pathologists. In this paper, a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) and improved fuzzy c-means clustering (IFCM) algorithm called CGAN-IFCM is proposed for the multi-class voice disorder detection of three common types of voice disorders. Existing benchmark datasets for voice disorders, the Saarbruecken Voice Database (SVD) and the Voice ICar fEDerico II Database (VOICED), use imbalanced classes. A generative adversarial network offers synthetic data to reduce bias in the detection model. Improved fuzzy c-means clustering considers the relationship between adjacent data points in the fuzzy membership function. To explain the necessity of CGAN and IFCM, a comparison is made between the algorithm with CGAN and that without CGAN. Moreover, the performance is compared between IFCM and traditional fuzzy c-means clustering. Lastly, the proposed CGAN-IFCM outperforms existing models in its true negative rate and true positive rate by 9.9-12.9% and 9.1-44.8%, respectively.","[Chui, Kwok Tai] Open Univ Hong Kong, Sch Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lytras, Miltiadis D.] King Abdulaziz Univ, POB 34689, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Lytras, Miltiadis D.] Effat Univ, Effat Coll Engn, POB 34689, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Vasant, Pandian] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Fundamental & Appl Sci Dept, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak Darul Rid, Malaysia","Chui, KT (corresponding author), Open Univ Hong Kong, Sch Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jktchui@ouhk.edu.hk; mlytras@acg.edu; pandian_m@utp.edu.my,"Chui, Kwok Tai/T-7346-2019; Lytras, Miltiadis/P-8195-2016","Chui, Kwok Tai/0000-0001-7992-9901; Lytras, Miltiadis/0000-0002-7281-5458",,,,48,1,1,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

In relation to the low-cost electrical components, a capacitor is an electrical component that can be used to sustain or improve the operating performance of an unbalanced electrical system in large-scale buildings so that energy efficiency improvement can be obtained. This is important to overcome the ineffective utilization of energy caused by the occurrence of power losses in an unbalanced electrical system of large-scale buildings. Further improvement of energy efficiency can be obtained by reducing an excessive amount of incoming power through the determination of tap setting for incoming transformer, and this is classified under the concept of conservative voltage regulation (CVR) approach. In order to solve the problem, the optimal capacitor placement and sizing (OCPS) with CVR is introduced as a new approach for energy efficiency improvement while ensuring a sustainable operation in an unbalanced electrical system of large-scale buildings. The proposed technique utilizes the artificial intelligence (AI) based differential evolution particle swarm optimization (DEPSO) technique with the objective function of total cost minimization for the real power losses, real power consumption, and capacitors installation. The effectiveness of the proposed technique to achieve energy efficiency improvement is investigated through a case study of an unbalanced electrical system in a large-scale office building. The significance of the research output is related to its low-cost technology that has the potential for a comprehensive, pragmatic implementation in large-scale buildings, and subsequently, it will significantly accelerate the increase of national agenda in energy efficiency.","[Abdul Razak, Muhd Azri] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Elect Engn, Cawangan Terengganu, Dungun 23000, Terengganu, Malaysia; [Othman, Muhammad Murtadha; Musirin, Ismail] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Elect Engn, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia; [Yahya, Mohd Ainor; Zakaria, Zilaila] Ibu Pejabat JKR Malaysia, Cawangan Kejuruteraan Elekt, Publ Works Dept Malaysia, Menara Kerja Raya Blok G,Jalan Sultan Salahuddin, Kuala Lumpur 50480, Malaysia","Othman, MM (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Elect Engn, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia.",azri1200@gmail.com; mamat505my@yahoo.com; i_musirin@yahoo.co.uk; ainor@jkr.gov.my; zilaila@jkr.gov.my,,,"Long-Term Research Grant (LRGS), Ministry of Education Malaysia [600-IRMI/LRGS 5/3 (001/2019)]; Institute of Research Management & Innovation (IRMI), Universiti Teknologi MARA, Malaysia [600-IRMI/DANA 5/3/BESTARI (119/2018)]; Centre of Excellence in Technology & Engineering (CREaTE), Public Works Department (PWD), Malaysia [100-IRMI/GOV 16/6/2 (013/2018)]","This research was funded by the Long-Term Research Grant (LRGS), Ministry of Education Malaysia for the program titled Decarbonisation of Grid with an Optimal Controller and Energy Management for Energy Storage System in Microgrid Applications, grant number 600-IRMI/LRGS 5/3 (001/2019); Institute of Research Management & Innovation (IRMI), Universiti Teknologi MARA, Malaysia, grant number 600-IRMI/DANA 5/3/BESTARI (119/2018); and Centre of Excellence in Technology & Engineering (CREaTE), Public Works Department (PWD), Malaysia, grant number 100-IRMI/GOV 16/6/2 (013/2018).",,44,0,0,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2020,12,13,,,,,,,5399,10.3390/su12135399,,,38,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MM5OZ,WOS:000550207200001,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

Thus, the utilities must adhere to certain environmental guidelines for sustainable power generation. Therefore, this paper presents a novel nature-inspired and population-based Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) methodology for controlling the emissions from thermal generating sources by solving single and multi-objective Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems. The OPF is a non-linear, non-convex, constrained optimization problem that primarily aims to minimize the fitness function by satisfying the equality and inequality constraints of the system. The cooperative behavior and dynamic chasing patterns of hawks to pounce on escaping prey is modeled mathematically to minimize the objective function. In this paper, fuel cost, real power loss and environment emissions are regarded as single and multi-objective functions for optimal adjustments of power system control variables. The different conflicting framed multi-objective functions have been solved using weighted sums using a no-preference method. The presented method is coded using MATLAB software and an IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 30-bus. The system was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of selective objectives. The obtained results are compared with the other Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), Moth Flame (MF) and Glow Warm Optimization (GWO). Additionally, the study on placement of Distributed Generation (DG) reveals that the system losses and emissions are reduced by an amount of 9.8355% and 26.2%, respectively.","[Islam, Mohammad Zohrul; Wahab, Noor Izzri Abdul; Veerasamy, Veerapandiyan; Hizam, Hashim; Mailah, Nashiren Farzilah; Mohd Nasir, Mohamad Nasrun] Univ Putra Malaysia, ALPER, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Serdang, Selangor 43400, Malaysia; [Guerrero, Josep M.] Aalborg Univ, Dept Energy Technol, Ctr Res Microgrids CROM, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark","Islam, MZ; Wahab, NIA (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, ALPER, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Serdang, Selangor 43400, Malaysia.",zohrul21@gmail.com; izzri@upm.edu.my; veerapandian220@gmail.com; hhizam@upm.edu.my; nashiren@upm.edu.my; joz@et.aau.dk; gs49219@student.upm.edu.my,"Veerasamy, Veerapandiyan/AAY-6241-2020; BIN ABDUL WAHAB, NOOR IZZRI/A-5696-2017; Guerrero, Josep/D-5519-2014","BIN ABDUL WAHAB, NOOR IZZRI/0000-0002-9042-9796; Guerrero, Josep/0000-0001-5236-4592; Islam, Mohammad Zohrul/0000-0002-0742-5699; Veerasamy, Veerapandiyan/0000-0002-7887-2613",Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) [9630000],This work has been carried out under the Putra Grant (9630000) supported by Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM).,,62,3,3,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2020,12,13,,,,,,,5248,10.3390/su12135248,,,26,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MM4KO,WOS:000550127700001,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

The physical features of the river basin are extremely hard to collect, especially for large rivers. Empirical data-driven models, such as stochastic and regression models, have been widely used in the field of streamflow forecasting. However, they suffered limited accuracy in predicting extreme streamflow. They also required raw data pre-processing prior to the modeling process, especially for lengthy data records and for large time-scale increments (e.g. monthly resolution). To overcome these challenges, data-driven forecasting models based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been widely used and resulted in enhancing the forecasting accuracy. Nevertheless, AI-based models required augmentation with proper optimization schemes to adjust the model parameters for optimal accuracy. Furthermore, in some cases, due to unsuitability of the optimization model, there is high possibility for overfitting of the AI model, which might cause poor prediction of input patterns that were not adequately mimicked. This study introduces a new approach to streamflow forecasting based on nonlinear system identification. The proposed technique employs Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS) to develop a nonlinear model of stream flow. The main advantage of using FOS is eliminating the requirement of raw data pre-processing and the need for an optimization scheme for model parameter adjustment since the FOS algorithm takes this into account while building the model. In addition, the FOS algorithm includes a pole-zero cancellation procedure that can detect and avoid the over-fitted models. The FOS-based nonlinear modeling approach was adopted in this research for the development of a streamflow forecasting model at Aswan High Dam using monthly basis natural streamflow records for 130 years. The results indicated that the proposed FOS algorithm outperformed the previously developed AI models of streamflow forecasting for large data records and for large time-scale increment (monthly resolution).","[Osman, Abdalla; Noureldin, Aboelmagd] Royal Mil Coll Canada, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Afan, Haitham Abdulmohsin] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Allawi, Mohammed Falah] Minist Water Resources, State Commiss Dams & Reservoirs, Baghdad, Iraq; [Jaafar, Othman; Hamzah, Firdaus Mohamad] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ahmed, Ali Najah] Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Energy Infrastruct IEI, Kajang, Selangor, Malaysia; [El-shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [El-shafie, Ahmed] United Arab Emirate Univ, Natl Water Ctr, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates","Afan, HA (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.",haithamabdulmohsinafan@duytan.edu.vn,,,Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) [FRGS/1/2019/TK01/UNITEN/02/3]; University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [GPF082A-2018],"The authors thankfully acknowledge Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS, Grant No.: FRGS/1/2019/TK01/UNITEN/02/3).

Then, the mentioned methods are utilised to identify a relationship between the input and output parameters of the EEB system. The amount of C-L was taken as the essential output of the EEB system, while the input parameters were channel length, channel depth, channel width, and air mass flow rate. The predicted results for data sets from each of the abovementioned models were evaluated according to several known statistical indices such as correlation coefficient (R-2), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), relative absolute error (RAE), and root relative squared error (RRSE) as well as novel ranking systems of colour intensity rating and total ranking method. The M5Rules has been proposed as the best predictive network in this study.

Such predictive tools can assist geotechnical engineers to easily determine the ultimate pile bearing capacity instead of conducting any difficult field tests. The main aim of this study is to predict the bearing capacity of pile developing several smart models, i.e., neuro-genetic, neuro-imperialism, genetic programing (GP) and artificial neural network (ANN). For this purpose, a number of concrete pile characteristics and its dynamic load test specifications were investigated to select pile cross-sectional area, pile length, pile set, hammer weight and drop height as five input variables which have the most impacts on pile bearing capacity as the single output variable. It should be noted that all the aforementioned parameters were measured by conducting a series of pile driving analyzer tests on precast concrete piles located in Pekanbaru, Indonesia. The recorded data were used to establish a database of 50 test cases. With regard to data modelling, many smart models of neuro-genetic, neuro-imperialism, GP and ANN were developed and then evaluated based on the three most common statistical indices, i.e., root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R-2) and variance account for (VAF). Based on the simulation results and the computed indices' values, it is observed that the proposed GP model with training and test RMSE values of 0.041 and 0.040, respectively, performs noticeably better than the proposed neuro-genetic model with RMSE values of 0.042 and 0.040, neuro-imperialism model with RMSE values of 0.045 and 0.059, and ANN model with RMSE values of 0.116 and 0.108 for training and test sets, respectively.

However, the existing AI models, such as multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN), are basically incomprehensible and facing problem when applied for time series prediction or forecasting. One of the main drawbacks of the MLP-NN model is the ability of the used default optimization algorithm [gradient decent algorithm (GDA)] to search for the optimal weight and bias values associated with each neuron within the MLP-NN architecture. In fact, GDA is a first-order iteration algorithm that usually trapped in local minima, especially when the time series is highly stochastic as in the river streamflow historical records. As a result, the overall performance of the MLP-NN model experienced inaccurate prediction or forecasting for the desired output. Moreover, due to the possibility of overfitting with MLP model which may lead to poor performance of prediction of the unseen input pattern, there is need to introduce new augmented algorithm capable of identifying the complexity of streamflow data and improve the prediction accuracy. Therefore, in this study, a replacement for the GDA with advanced optimization algorithm, namely intelligent water drop (IWD), is proposed to enhance the searching procedure for the global optima. The new proposed forecasting model is, namely MLP-IWD. Two different historical rivers streamflow data have been collected from Nong Son and Thanh My stations on the Vu Gia Thu Bon river basin for period between (1978 and 2016) in order to examine the performance of the proposed MLP-IWD model. In addition, in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed MLP-IWD model under different conditions, four different scenarios for the model input-output architecture have been investigated. Results showed that the proposed MLP-IWD model outperformed the classical MLP-NN model and significantly improve the forecasting accuracy for the river streamflow. Finally, the proposed model could be generalized and applied in different rivers worldwide.","[Quoc Bao Pham; Afan, Haitham Abdulmohsin] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Quoc Bao Pham] Duy Tan Univ, Fac Environm & Chem Engn, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Mohammadi, Babak] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Ahmed, Ali Najah] Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Energy Infrastruct IEI, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Nguyen Thi Thuy Linh] Thuyloi Univ, 175 Tay Son, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Ngoc Duong Vo] Univ Danang, Univ Sci & Technol, Da Nang, Vietnam; [Moazenzadeh, Roozbeh] Shahrood Univ Technol, Fac Agr, Dept Water Engn, Shahrood, Iran; [Yu, Pao-Shan] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [El-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [El-Shafie, Ahmed] United Arab Emirates Univ, Natl Water Ctr NWC, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates","Linh, NTT (corresponding author), Thuyloi Univ, 175 Tay Son, Hanoi, Vietnam.",linhntt@tlu.edu.vn,"Pham, Quoc Bao/AAD-5611-2020; Mohammadi, Babak/G-4012-2018","Pham, Quoc Bao/0000-0002-0468-5962; Mohammadi, Babak/0000-0001-8427-5965; Nguyen Thi Thuy, Linh/0000-0001-8631-9941; Moazenzadeh, Roozbeh/0000-0002-1057-3801",,,,65,3,3,2,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1432-7643,1433-7479,,SOFT COMPUT,Soft Comput.,DEC,2020,24,23,,,SI,,18039,18056,,10.1007/s00500-020-05058-5,,Jun-20,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Computer Science,OQ9QL,WOS:000538214500001,,,,,11/3/2021

Contrary to the dispatch processing of the PPS technique, which mainly relies on the dispatching of each limited energy unit in sequential order, a modified artificial bee colony with a new searching mechanism (MABC-NSM) is proposed. TheSUCis originated from the summation of the Saving Energy Cost and Saving Expected Cycling Cost of the generating system. In addition, further investigation for obtaining the optimal value of theSUCis performed between theSUCdetermined directly and indirectly estimated by referring to the energy reduction of thermal units (ERTU). Comparisons were made using MABC-NSM and a standard artificial bee colony and verified on the modified IEEE RTS-79 with different peak load demands.

It is estimated that billions of dollars are wasted annually due to these illegal activities. DSOs around the world, especially in underdeveloped countries, still utilize conventional time consuming and inefficient methods for Non-Technical Loss (NTL) detection. This research work attempts to solve the mentioned problem by developing an efficient energy theft detection model in order to identify the fraudster customers in a power distribution system. The key motivation for the present study is to assist the DSOs in their fight against energy theft. The proposed computational model initially utilizes a set of distinct features extracted from the monthly consumers' consumption data, obtained from Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO) Pakistan, to segregate the honest and the fraudulent customers. The Pearson's chi-square feature selection algorithm is adopted to select the most relevant features among the extracted ones. Finally, the Boosted C5.0 Decision Tree (DT) algorithm is used to classify the honest and the fraudster consumers based on the outcomes of the selected features. To validate the superiority of the proposed NTL detection approach, its performance is matched with that of few state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms (one of most exciting recent technologies in Artificial Intelligence), like Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Extreme Gradient Bossting (XGBoost).

It was found that the S-shaped component of metasurface induces a single bright mode, whereas the rectangular strip manifests two bright modes with strong coupling of incidence electromagnetic waves. When both the metasurface components were placed in the proximity, the PIT-like phenomenon was observed. The effects of rotational angle of the metasurface as well as the angle of incidence on the transmission spectra (of the metasurface) were also investigated. Both the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) waves were used to explore the PIT effect. It was noticed that the PIT window could be easily tuned by altering the horizontal distance between the resonator components (i.e., the S-shaped structure and rectangular strip). It is expected that the proposed metasurface structure would be prudent in switching, ultrafast sensing and optical applications.","[Bilal, R. M. H.; Rahim, A.

Four common machine learning techniques, i.e. random forest, k-nearest neighbour, support vector machine and perceptron, were compared in terms of accuracy and memory usage so that a real-time standalone gait diagnosis device can be constructed using low-end inertial measurement units (IMUs). With proper re-sampling and normalisation, they discovered that the support vector machine and perceptron resulted in the top two highest accuracies (96-99%) among the four machine learning methods. The memory requirement of the perceptron is the lowest among the machine learning methods. Therefore, perceptron was selected as the classification algorithm for the standalone gait diagnosis device. The trained perceptron was transferred to the thigh and shank's IMUs to process the data locally in real-time. The constructed standalone gait diagnosis device lit up green or red light emitting diodes when normal or abnormal gaits were detected, respectively. This standalone device was further tested in real-life and achieved a mean classification accuracy of 96.50%.","[Han, Yi Chiew; Wong, Kiing Ing] Curtin Univ Malaysia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, CDT250, Miri, Malaysia; [Murray, Iain] Curtin Univ Australia, Sch Engn Comp & Math Sci, Perth, WA, Australia","Han, YC (corresponding author), Curtin Univ Malaysia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, CDT250, Miri, Malaysia.",yichiew@hotmail.com,,"Han, Yi Chiew/0000-0002-0389-1369",,,,24,0,0,2,6,INST ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY-IET,HERTFORD,"MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE SIX HILLS WAY STEVENAGE, HERTFORD SG1 2AY, ENGLAND",1751-9675,1751-9683,,IET SIGNAL PROCESS,IET Signal Process.,JUN,2020,14,4,,,,,243,250,,10.1049/iet-spr.2019.0228,,,8,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Engineering,LV0HB,WOS:000538124300006,,,,,11/3/2021

Various previous works have showcased the strength and feasibility of this approach, especially on its robustness against local variations. However, the projected features are numerous and substantial in dimension, which is largely due to the convolution of multiscale and orientation of wavelets. Such features, when used in practical face recognition, would require relatively lengthy classification process, particularly when it involves computationally extensive local classifier or experts, such as ensembles of local cosine similarity (ELCS) classifier. The authors address this issue by simultaneously reducing the size of Gabor features laterally and locally using a manifold learning method called locally linear embedding (LLE). This method is thus denoted as locally lateral normalised local Gabor feature vector with LLE (LGFV/LN/LLE). Results on several publicly available face datasets reveal the superiority of the authors' approach in terms of improvements in feature compression of LGFV features by up to a reduction of 95% of total dimensionality while increasing the average classification accuracy by 26%. Altogether, the authors show that their LGFV/LN/LLE augmented by ELCS classifiers delivers equivalent result when compared against the state-of-the-art.","[Zaman, Fadhlan Hafizhelmi Kamaru] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Elect Engn, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia","Zaman, FHK (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Elect Engn, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia.",fadhlan@uitm.edu.my,,"Kamaruzaman, Fadhlan/0000-0003-1161-6452",Universiti Teknologi MARA Shah Alam under Dana Kecemerlangan Bestari [600-IRMI/DANA 5/3/BESTARI (055/2017)],"The authors would like to thank Dr. Aleix M.

This investigation has applied a unique approach of meta-frontier analysis to estimate and analyze the innovation in internet companies in China. A unique dataset of Chinese internet companies from 2000 to 2017 has been utilized to estimate and compare the innovation over the period of study. The change in technology gap ratio (TGR) and a shift in production function have translated into innovation which was overlooked by previous studies. It is found that the production function of internet companies is moving upward in the presence of external factors such as smartphones invention, mobile internet, mobile payments, and artificial intelligence, etc. Consequently, a sudden increase in TGR is captured due to the innovation of some companies. Hence, the average TE of the industry falls caused by the increased distance of other companies form industry production function. However, the innovation advantage defused when other companies start imitating and the average TE elevates. A steady increase in the TGR index revealed that the continuous innovation-based growth of some companies lifting the production frontier upward. This provides the opportunity for other companies to imitate and provides continuous growth in the industry.

AI is invigorating biomarker research on various fronts, right from the cataloguing of key mutations driving the complex diseases like cancer to the elucidation of molecular networks underlying diseases. In this study, we have explored the potential of AI through machine learning approaches to propose that these methods can act as recommendation systems to sort and prioritize important genes and finally predict the presence of specific biomarkers. Essentially, we have utilized microarray datasets from open-source databases, like GEO, for breast, lung, colon, and ovarian cancer. In this context, different clustering analyses like hierarchical and k-means along with random forest algorithm have been utilized to classify important genes from a pool of several thousand genes.

Agreement on fate of borderline blastocysts is poor and does not improve with a modified blastocyst grading system,HUMAN REPRODUCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,blastocyst; embryo; inter-observer agreement; morphology; grading criteria; grade C,EMBRYO; MORPHOLOGY; PREGNANCY; IMPLANTATION,"STUDY QUESTION: What is the inter-observer agreement among embryologists for decision to freeze blastocysts of borderline morphology and can it be improved with a modified grading system? SUMMARY ANSWER: The inter-observer agreement among embryologists deciding whether to freeze blastocysts of marginal morphology was low and was not improved by a modified grading system. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: While previous research on inter-observer variability on the decision of which embryo to transfer from a cohort of blastocysts is good, the impact of grading variability regarding decision to freeze borderline blastocysts has not been investigated. Agreement for inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) grade is only fair, factors which contribute to the grade that influences decision to freeze. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a prospective study involving 18 embryologists working at four different IVF clinics within a single organisation between January 2019 and July 2019. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All embryologists currently practicing blastocyst grading at a multi-site organisation were invited to participate. The survey was comprised of blastocyst images in three planes and asked (i) the likelihood of freezing and (ii) whether the blastocyst would be frozen based on visual assessment. Blastocysts varied by quality and were categorised as either top (n = 20), borderline (n = 60) or non-viable/degenerate quality (n = 20). A total of 1800 freeze decisions were assessed. To assess the impact of grading criteria on inter-observer agreement for decision to freeze, the survey was taken once when the embryologists used the Gardner criteria and again 6 months after transitioning to a modified Gardner criterion with four grades for ICM and TE. The fourth grade was introduced with the aim to promote higher levels of agreement for the clinical usability decision when the blastocyst was of marginal quality. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The inter-observer agreement for decision to freeze was near perfect (kappa 1.0) for top and non-viable/degenerate quality blastocysts, and this was not affected by the blastocysts grading criteria used (top quality; P = 0.330 and non-viable/degenerate quality; P = 0.18). In contrast, the cohort of borderline blastocysts received a mixed freeze rate (average 52.7%) during the first survey, indicative of blastocysts that showed uncertain viability and promoting significant disagreement for decision to freeze among the embryologists (kappa 0.304). After transitioning to a modified Gardner criteria with an additional grading tier, the average freeze rate increased (64.8%; P < 0.0001); however, the inter-observer agreement for decision to freeze was unchanged (kappa 0.301). Therefore, significant disagreement for decision to freeze among embryologists is an ongoing issue not resolved by the two grading criteria assessed here. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Blastocyst assessment was performed from time-lapse images in three planes, rather than with a microscope in the laboratory. The inter-observer agreement for decision to freeze may be lower for embryologists working in different clinics with different grading protocols. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The decision to freeze a blastocyst with borderline morphology is a common clinical issue that has the potential to arise for any patient during blastocyst culture. Disagreement for decision to freeze these blastocysts, and therefore clinical usability in frozen embryo transfer cycles, affects consistency in patient care due to a potential impact on cumulative live birth rates, as well as financial, emotional and time costs associated with the frozen embryo transfer cycles. We demonstrate significant disagreement for decision to freeze borderline blastocysts among embryologists using the same grading scheme within a large multisite organisation, a phenomenon which was not improved with a modified grading system. Decision-making around borderline embryos is an area requiring further research, especially as studies continue to demonstrate the reduced but modest live birth rates for low quality blastocysts (Grade C). These results provide support for emerging technology for embryo assessment, such as artificial intelligence.","[Hammond, Elizabeth R.; Morbeck, Dean E.] Fertil Associates, Dept Embryol, 7 Ellerslie Racecourse Dr, Auckland, New Zealand; [Foong, Audrey Kit Mei; Rosli, Norazlin; Morbeck, Dean E.] Sunfert Int Fertil Ctr, Dept Embryol, 7 Jalan Kerinchi, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Morbeck, Dean E.] Univ Auckland, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, 85 Pk Rd, Auckland, New Zealand","Hammond, ER (corresponding author), Level 3-7 Ellerslie Racecourse Dr, Auckland 1051, New Zealand.",ehammond@fertilityassociates.co.nz,,,,,,19,2,2,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0268-1161,1460-2350,,HUM REPROD,Hum.

Additional investigations are needed to evaluate sonographic parameters and compare their performances with artificial intelligence (AI) methods. The aim of this study is to compare the performance of shear wave elastography, morphometry, and AI techniques to predict MN entrapment accurately. 200 wrists including 100 CTS and 100 control wrists were included. Twelve morphological and five elasticity parameters were measured from each MN. Two AI techniques namely, support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to diagnose CTS. MN area with area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.949 and mean elasticity with AUC of 0.942 showed the highest performance to differentiate CTS from control wrists among morphological and elasticity parameters, respectively. The CNN achieved the best performance with AUC of 0.980, while SVM obtained AUC of 0.943 in testing dataset to diagnose CTC. MN is larger, stiffer, more irregular and extended in CTS patients. Deep learning technique yielded the highest performance in diagnosing CTS automatically. AI methods have vast potential to be implemented in clinical practice as an auxiliary tool for the assessment of CTS with high accuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, the available DGA methods have certain limitations because every method depends on the concentration of the dissolved gases. Therefore, in this work, hybrid feature selection-artificial intelligence-gravitational search algorithm (GSA) techniques were proposed to determine the fault type of power transformers based on DGA data. The artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied include support vector machine and artificial neural network. Both AI methods were optimised by GSA to enhance the accuracy of the results. Feature selections using stepwise regression and robust regression were applied to utilise only significant gases. The accuracy of the results was tested with various ratios of testing and training data. Comparison of the results using the proposed method with other optimisation methods and the previous works was performed to validate the performance of the proposed technique. It was observed that the proposed hybrid feature selection-AI-GSA technique yields reasonable accuracy although fewer types of dissolved gases were used. Therefore, the proposed method can be recommended for the application of automated power transformer fault type detection based on DGA data in practice.","[Illias, Hazlee Azil; Chan, Kai Choon; Mokhlis, Hazlie] Univ Malaya, Dept Elect Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Illias, HA (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Elect Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",h.illias@um.edu.my,"Illias, Hazlee/K-2630-2015; Mokhlis, Hazlie/B-8616-2010","Mokhlis, Hazlie/0000-0002-1166-1934","University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [H-16001-D000048, GPF077A-2018]; Ministry of Higher Education, MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [H-16001-D000048, GPF077A-2018]","The authors thank the University of Malaya and Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia for supporting this work through research grants of HIR (H-16001-D000048) and Faculty Research Grant (GPF077A-2018).",,38,0,0,5,7,INST ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY-IET,HERTFORD,"MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE SIX HILLS WAY STEVENAGE, HERTFORD SG1 2AY, ENGLAND",1751-8687,1751-8695,,IET GENER TRANSM DIS,IET Gener.

Time-efficient communication systems should have the ability to function in severe propagation conditions in smart grid applications. The data/packet communications need to be maintained by synchronized timing and reliability through equally considering the signal deterioration occurrences, which are propagation delay, phase errors and channel conditions. Phase synchronization plays a vital part in the digital smart grid to get precise and real-time control measurement information. IEEE C37.118 and IEC 61850 had implemented for the synchronization communication to measure as well as control the smart grid applications. Both IEEE C37.118 and IEC 61850 experienced a huge propagation and packet delays due to synchronization precision issues. Because of these delays and errors, measurement and monitoring of the smart grid application in real-time is not accurate. Therefore, it has been investigated that the time synchronization in real-time is a critical challenge in smart grid applications, and for this issue, other errors raised consequently. The existing communication systems are designed with the phasor measurement unit (PMU) along with communication protocol IEEE C37.118 and uses the GPS timestamps as the reference clock stamps. The absence of GPS increases the clock offsets, which surely can hamper the synchronization process and the full control measurement system that can be imprecise. Therefore, to reduce this clock offsets, a new algorithm is needed which may consider any alternative reference timestamps rather than GPS. The revolutionary Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables the industrial revolution to provide a significant performance to engineering solutions. Therefore, this article proposed the AI-based Synchronization scheme to mitigate smart grid timing issues. The backpropagation neural network is applied as the AI method that employs the timing estimations and error corrections for the precise performances. The novel AIFS scheme is considered the radio communication functionalities in order to connect the external timing server. The performance of the proposed AIFS scheme is evaluated using a MATLAB-based simulation approach. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs better than the existing system.","[Hasan, Mohammad Kamrul] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Ahmed, Musse Mohamud] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Kota Samarahan 94300, Malaysia; [Hashim, Aisha Hassan Abdalla] Int Islamic Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Gombak, Malaysia; [Razzaque, Abdur] Green Univ Bangladesh, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Islam, Shayla] UCSI Univ, Inst Comp Sci & Digital Innovat, South Wing, Kuala Lumpur 56000, Malaysia; [Pandey, Biswajeet] Gyanc Res Lab, Gurgaon, India","Hasan, MK (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Bangi 43600, Malaysia.",mkhasan@ukm.edu.my,"Ahmed, Musse Mohamud/N-7807-2017; Hasan, Mohammad Kamrul/F-4782-2015","Ahmed, Musse Mohamud/0000-0001-5132-5743; Hasan, Mohammad Kamrul/0000-0001-5511-0205",,,,22,9,9,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-6212,1572-834X,,WIRELESS PERS COMMUN,Wirel.

Terrorism not only disturbs the law and order situations in a society but also affects the quality of lives of humans and makes them suppressed physically and emotionally and deprives them of enjoying life. The more the civilizations have advanced, the more the people are working towards exploring different mechanisms to protect the mankind from terrorism. Different techniques have been used as counterterrorism to protect the lives of individuals in society and to improve the quality of life in general. Machine learning methods have been recently explored to develop techniques for counterterrorism based on artificial intelligence (AI). Since deep learning has recently gained more popularity in machine learning domain, in this paper, these techniques are explored to understand the behavior of terrorist activities. Five different models based on deep neural network (DNN) are created to understand the behavior of terrorist activities such as is the attack going to be successful or not? Or whether the attack is going to be suicide or not? Or what type of weapon is going to be used in the attack? Or what type of attack is going to be carried out? Or what region is going to be attacked? The models are implemented in single-layer neural network (NN), five-layer DNN, and three traditional machine learning algorithms, i.e., logistic regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes. The performance of the DNN is compared with NN and the three machine learning algorithms, and it is demonstrated that the performance in DNN is more than 95% in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, while ANN and traditional machine learning algorithms have achieved a maximum of 83% accuracy. This concludes that DNN is a suitable model to be used for predicting the behavior of terrorist activities. Our experiments also demonstrate that the dataset for terrorist activities is big data; therefore, a DNN is a suitable model to process big data and understand the underlying patterns in the dataset.","[Uddin, M.

The occurrence of karst springs over large areas is often poorly documented, and interpolation strategies are often utilized to map the distribution and discharge potential of springs. This study develops a novel method to delineate karst spring zones on the basis of various hydrogeological factors. A case study of the Bojnourd Region, Iran, where spring discharge measurements are available for 359 sites, is used to demonstrate application of the new approach. Spatial mapping is achieved using ensemble modelling, which is based on certainty factors (CF) and logistic regression (LR). Maps of the CF and LR components of groundwater potential were generated individually, and then, combined to prepare an ensemble map of the study area. The accuracy (A) of the ensemble map was then assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results of this analysis show that LR (A = 78%) outperformed CF (A = 67%) in terms of the comparison between model predictions and known occurrences of karst springs (i.e., calibration data). However, combining the CF and LR results through ensemble modelling produced superior accuracy (A = 85%) in terms of spring potential mapping. By combining CF and LR statistical models through ensemble modelling, weaknesses in CF and LR methods are offset, and therefore, we recommend this ensemble approach for similar karst mapping projects. The methodology developed here offers an efficient method for assessing spring discharge and karst spring potentials over regional scales.","[Viet-Ha Nhu] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Viet-Ha Nhu] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Rahmati, Omid] AREEO, Soil Conservat & Watershed Management Res Dept, Kurdistan Agr & Nat Resources Res & Educ Ctr, Sanandaj 6616936311, Iran; [Falah, Fatemeh] Lorestan Univ, Fac Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Watershed Management, Lorestan 6815144316, Iran; [Shojaei, Saeed] Islamic Azad Univ, Zahedan Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Zahedan 9816743545, Iran; [Al-Ansari, Nadhir] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Kurdistan Studies Inst, Dept Zrebar Lake Environm Res, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Shirzadi, Ataollah] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Gorski, Krzysztof] Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Mech Engn, Chrobrego 45 St, PL-26200 Radom, Poland; [Hoang Nguyen] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Bin Ahmad, Baharin] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Dept Geoinformat, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia","Al-Ansari, N (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden.; Nguyen, H (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.",nhuvietha@tdtu.edu.vn; o.rahmati@areeo.ac.ir; falahfateme69@gmail.com; sshojaei@ut.ac.ir; nadhir.alansari@ltu.se; h.shahabi@uok.ac.ir; a.shirzadi@uok.ac.ir; krzysztof.gorski@uthrad.pl; nguyenhoang23@duytan.edu.vn; baharinahmad@utm.my,"Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017; Shirzadi, Ataollah/AAX-9800-2020; Gorski, Krzysztof/ABD-6114-2020; Rahmati, Omid/R-2184-2016","Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; Gorski, Krzysztof/0000-0003-0951-3147; Rahmati, Omid/0000-0001-5672-8525; Nguyen, Hoang/0000-0001-6122-8314; Al-Ansari, Nadhir/0000-0002-6790-2653; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0003-1666-1180; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0001-9668-8687",,,,154,13,13,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,APR,2020,12,4,,,,,,,985,10.3390/w12040985,,,25,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,LX0JR,WOS:000539527500062,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

As a result, many scientists study the phenomenon, and some of them have focused on producing landslide susceptibility maps that can be used by land-use managers to reduce injury and damage. This paper contributes to this effort by comparing the power and effectiveness of five machine learning, benchmark algorithms-Logistic Model Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Tree, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine-in creating a reliable shallow landslide susceptibility map for Bijar City in Kurdistan province, Iran. Twenty conditioning factors were applied to 111 shallow landslides and tested using the One-R attribute evaluation (ORAE) technique for modeling and validation processes. The performance of the models was assessed by statistical-based indexes including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). Results indicate that all the five machine learning models performed well for shallow landslide susceptibility assessment, but the Logistic Model Tree model (AUC = 0.932) had the highest goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, followed by the Logistic Regression (AUC = 0.932), Naive Bayes Tree (AUC = 0.864), ANN (AUC = 0.860), and Support Vector Machine (AUC = 0.834) models. Therefore, we recommend the use of the Logistic Model Tree model in shallow landslide mapping programs in semi-arid regions to help decision makers, planners, land-use managers, and government agencies mitigate the hazard and risk.","[Viet-Ha Nhu] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City 758307, Vietnam; [Viet-Ha Nhu] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City 758307, Vietnam; [Shirzadi, Ataollah] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Kurdistan Studies Inst, Dept Zrebar Lake Environm Res, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Singh, Sushant K.] Virtusa Corp, 10 Marshall St, Irvington, NJ 07111 USA; [Al-Ansari, Nadhir] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Clague, John J.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Jaafari, Abolfazl] Agr Res Educ & Extens Org AREEO, Res Inst Forests & Rangelands, Tehran 13185116, Iran; [Chen, Wei] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geol & Environm, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wei] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Coal Resources Explorat & Comprehens Util, Xian 710021, Peoples R China; [Miraki, Shaghayegh] Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources Sari, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Watershed Sci Engn, Mazandaran 4818168984, Iran; [Dou, Jie] Nagaoka Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1603-1 Kami Tomioka, Nagaoka, Niigata 9402188, Japan; [Luu, Chinh] Natl Univ Civil Engn, Fac Hydraul Engn, Hanoi 112000, Vietnam; [Gorski, Krzysztof] Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Mech Engn, Chrobrego 45 St, PL-26200 Radom, Poland; [Binh Thai Pham] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Huu Duy Nguyen] VNU Univ Sci, Fac Geog, 334 Nguyen Trai, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Bin Ahmad, Baharin] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia","Al-Ansari, N (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden.; Pham, BT (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.",nhuvietha@tdtu.edu.vn; a.shirzadi@uok.ac.ir; h.shahabi@uok.ac.ir; sushantorama@gmail.com; nadhir.alansari@ltu.se; jclague@sfu.ca; jaafari@rifr-ac.ir; chenwei0930@xust.edu.cn; Shaghayegh.miraki@yahoo.com; douj888@gmail.com; luuthidieuchinh@nuce.edu.vn; krzysztof.gorski@uthrad.pl; phamthaibinh2@duytan.edu.vn; huuduy151189@gmail.com; baharinahmad@utm.my,"Jaafari, Abolfazl/AAG-5500-2019; Shirzadi, Ataollah/AAX-9800-2020; ????, Wei Chen/ABB-8669-2020; Gorski, Krzysztof/ABD-6114-2020; Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017; Luu, Chinh/AAB-4161-2019; Jaafari, Abolfazl/D-7305-2019; Singh, Sushant/G-5007-2015; dou, jie/K-2809-2013","Gorski, Krzysztof/0000-0003-0951-3147; Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; Luu, Chinh/0000-0002-3128-3774; Jaafari, Abolfazl/0000-0002-3441-6560; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0003-1666-1180; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0001-9668-8687; Singh, Sushant/0000-0001-6065-6050; Al-Ansari, Nadhir/0000-0002-6790-2653; dou, jie/0000-0001-5930-199X",,,,165,1,1,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Modeling and validation were done on 111 shallow landslide locations using 20 conditioning factors tested by the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) technique. We assessed model performance with statistically based indexes, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, kappa, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). All four machine learning models that we tested yielded excellent goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, but the RF-RAF ensemble model (AUC = 0.936) outperformed the BA-RAF, RS-RAF (AUC = 0.907), and RAF (AUC = 0.812) models. The results also show that the Random Forest model significantly improved the predictive capability of the RAF-based classifier and, therefore, can be considered as a useful and an effective tool in regional shallow landslide susceptibility mapping.","[Viet-Ha Nhu] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Viet-Ha Nhu] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Shirzadi, Ataollah] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan; Asl, Davood Talebpour] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Kurdistan Studies Inst, Dept Zrebar Lake Environm Res, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Chen, Wei] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geol & Environm, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wei] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Coal Resources Explorat & Comprehens Util, Xian 710021, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Clague, John J.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Geertsema, Marten] Minist Forests Lands Nat Resource Operat & Rural, Prince George, BC V2L 1R5, Canada; [Jaafari, Abolfazl] Res Inst Forests & Rangelands Agr Res Educ & Exte, Tehran 13185116, Iran; [Avand, Mohammadtaghi] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Nat Resources & Marine Sci, Dept Watershed Management Engn & Sci, Tehran 14115111, Iran; [Miraki, Shaghayegh] Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources Sari, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Watershed Sci Engn, Mazandaran 4818168984, Iran; [Binh Thai Pham] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Bin Ahmad, Baharin] Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Lee, Saro] Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources KIGAM, Geosci Platform Res Div, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejeon 34132, South Korea; [Lee, Saro] Korea Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geophys Explorat, 217 Gajeong Ro, Daejeon 34113, South Korea","Pham, BT (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.; Lee, S (corresponding author), Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources KIGAM, Geosci Platform Res Div, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejeon 34132, South Korea.; Lee, S (corresponding author), Korea Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geophys Explorat, 217 Gajeong Ro, Daejeon 34113, South Korea.",nhuvietha@tdtu.edu.vn; a.shirzadi@uok.ac.ir; h.shahabi@uok.ac.ir; chenwei0930@xust.edu.cn; jclague@sfu.ca; marten.geertsema@gmail.com; jaafari@rifr-ac.ir; mt.avand@modares.ac.ir; Shaghayegh.miraki@yahoo.com; d.talebpour@uok.ac.ir; phamthaibinh2@duytan.edu.vn; baharinahmad@utm.my; leesaro@kigam.re.kr,"Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017; avand, mohammadtaghi/AAG-6319-2019; Shirzadi, Ataollah/AAX-9800-2020; ????, Wei Chen/ABB-8669-2020; Jaafari, Abolfazl/AAG-5500-2019","Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; avand, mohammadtaghi/0000-0001-7196-5051; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0003-1666-1180; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0001-9668-8687","Basic Research Project of the Korea Institute of Geoscience, Mineral Resources (KIGAM) - Minister of Science and ICT","This research was supported by the Basic Research Project of the Korea Institute of Geoscience, Mineral Resources (KIGAM), which is funded by the Minister of Science and ICT.",,135,20,20,7,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,APR,2020,11,4,,,,,,,421,10.3390/f11040421,,,28,Forestry,Forestry,LP9JT,WOS:000534632500059,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

Flyrock is the unwanted throw of rock fragments during blasting and is the major cause of considerable damage in and around the mines. The present research aimed to propose a new intelligence-based method to predict flyrock. In this regard, the recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN) combined with the genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. For checking the suitability of the RFNN-GA model, artificial neural network (ANN), hybrid ANN and GA and a nonlinear regression model were also employed. To achieve the aims of the research, data for 70 blasting sites including four input parameters (spacing, burden, stemming and maximum charge per delay) and one output parameter (flyrock) were gathered from two quarry mines at the Shur River dam, Iran. The performance of the proposed prediction methods was then assessed with statistical evaluation criteria, i.e., R-square and root mean square error. The results indicate the proposed RFNN-GA model was more superior for prediction of flyrock than the GA-ANN, ANN and nonlinear regression models. According to a sensitivity analysis, the maximum charge per delay was the most influential parameter in flyrock prediction in this case.","[Rad, Hima Nikafshan] Tabari Univ Babol, Coll Comp Sci, Babol Sar, Iran; [Jusoh, Wan Amizah Wan] Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn & Environm, Batu Pahat 86400, Johor Darul Tak, Malaysia; [Tahir, M.

Due to a lot of input variables such as (upper layer thickness/foundation width (h/B) ratio, footing width (B), top and bottom soil layer properties) finding a reliable solution for such a complex engineering problem is difficult. Most of the available solutions are based on very limited experimental works. To assess the capability of proposed methods a new ranking system called CER (color intensity rating) based on their result of above indices was developed. As a result, although all provided methods, after being optimized, could successfully predict the bearing capacity of shallow footing in the two-layer subsoil and PSO-ANN could perform better compared to other techniques. Based on RMSE, R-2 and VAF, values of (0.01, 0.99, and 99.90) and (0.01, 0.99, and 99.90) were found, respectively, for the training and testing datasets of PSO-ANN model. In this regard, the accuracy of other hybrid algorithm of GA-ANN model with RMSE, R-2 and VAF of (0.05, 0.99, and 97.80) and (0.06, 0.99, and 97.57), respectively, for the training and testing datasets was slightly lower than the PSO-ANN model. This shows the superiority of the PSO-ANN model in the prediction of a highly complex real-world engineering problem.","[Moayedi, Hossein] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Moayedi, Hossein] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Moatamediyan, Arash] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Sonqor Branch, Sonqor, Iran; [Hoang Nguyen; Xuan-Nam Bui] Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Min Fac, Dept Surface Min, 18 Vien St, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Hoang Nguyen; Xuan-Nam Bui] Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Ctr Min Electromech Res, 18 Vien St, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Dieu Tien Bui] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Rashie, Ahmad Safuan A.] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Geotech & Transportat, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Rashie, Ahmad Safuan A.] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Ctr Trop Geoengn Geotrop, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia","Moayedi, H (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.; Moayedi, H (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",hossein.moayedi@tdtu.edu.vn,"; Moayedi, Hossein/B-7999-2011","Nguyen, Hoang/0000-0001-6122-8314; Bui, Xuan-Nam/0000-0001-5953-4902; Moayedi, Hossein/0000-0002-5625-1437",,,,76,53,53,28,48,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0177-0667,1435-5663,,ENG COMPUT-GERMANY,Eng.

Hence, the limiting velocity should be determined to keep the channel bottom clean from sediment deposits. Recently, sediment transport modeling using various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has attracted the interest of many researchers. The current integrated study highlights unique insight for modeling of sediment transport in sewer and urban drainage systems. A novel methodology based on the combination of sensitivity and uncertainty analyses with a machine learning technique is proposed as a tool for selection of the best input combination for modeling process at non-deposition conditions of sediment transport. Utilizing one to seven dimensionless parameters, 127 models are developed in the current study. In order to evaluate the different parameter combinations and select the training and testing data, four strategies are considered. Considering the densimetric Froude number (Fr) as the dependent parameter, a model with independent parameters of volumetric sediment concentration (C-V) and relative particle size (d/R) gave the best results with a mean absolute relative error (MARE) of 0.1 and a root means square error (RMSE) of 0.67. Uncertainty analysis is applied with a machine learning technique to investigate the credibility of the proposed methods. The percentage of the observed sample data bracketed by 95% predicted uncertainty bound (95PPU) is computed to assess the uncertainty of the best models.

Despite the environmental danger of TPAH, its laboratory quantification is laborious, which consumes appreciable time and other valuable resources. This research work develops a computational intelligence-based model for the first time, which directly estimates and quantifies the level of TPAH of any environmental solid samples using total petroleum hydrocarbons descriptor that can be easily determined experimentally. The hyperparameters of the developed support vector regression (SVR)-based model are optimized using manual search (MS) approach and genetic algorithm (GA) search approach with Gaussian and polynomial kernel functions. Experimental validation of the developed model was carried out using samples obtained from the marine sediments of Arabian Gulf Sea. The future generalization and predictive strength of the developed models were assessed using correlation coefficient (CC), root-mean-square error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD). GA-SVR-Gaussian performs better than MS-SVR and GA-SVR-poly with performance enhancement of 63.89% and 536.32%, respectively, on the basis of MAPD as a performance-measuring parameter, while MS-SVR model performs better than GA-SVR-poly with performance improvement of 288.25% using MAPD to evaluate the model performance. The estimation accuracy and generalization strength of the developed models indicate the potential of the models in measuring the level of environmental pollution of oil-spilled area without experimental stress, while experimental precision is preserved.","[Akinpelu, Adeola A.; Ali, Md.

Meanwhile, the detection and classification of micro-expressions have been attracting attention from various research communities in the recent few years. In this paper, we first review the processes of a conventional optical-flow-based recognition system. Concisely, it comprises four basic steps: facial landmarks annotations (to detect the face and locate the landmark coordinates), optical flow guided images computation (to describe the dynamic changes on the face), feature extraction (to summarize the features encoded) and emotion class categorization (to build a classification model based on the given training data). Secondly, a few approaches have been implemented to improve the feature extraction part, such as exploiting GAN to generate more image samples. Particularly, several variations of optical flow are computed in order to generate optimal images, which lead to high recognition accuracies. Next, GAN, a combination of Generator and Discriminator, is utilized to generate new fake images to increase the sample size. Thirdly, a modified state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks is proposed. In brief, multiple optical flow derived components are adopted in the OFF-ApexNet structure to better represent the facial subtle motion changes. From the experiment results obtained, the additional optical flow information computed does not complement the feature extraction stage, and thus leading to poorer recognition performance. On the other hand, the implementation of GAN to the input data improves the performance in SMIC dataset, by achieving the accuracy of 61.80%, 62.20% and 60.98% for AC-GAN, SAGAN and without GAN images, respectively.","[Liong, Sze-Teng] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Taichung, Taiwan; [Gan, Y.

This work focused on the integration of unsupervised learning with cognitive modelling to detect and diagnose unknown fault conditions. It is achieved by integrating two techniques: (i) incremental one class algorithm to identify anomaly condition and introduce a new state of fault to the current fault states if an unknown fault occurs, and (ii) dynamic shallow neural network to learn and classify the fault state. The proposed framework is applied to the well-known Tennessee Eastman process and achieved significantly better results compared to results reported by earlier studies. Laboratory experiments are also performed using a pilot-scale system to test the validity of the approach.

It also generates large amounts of sediment that can adversely impact downstream river channels. The main objective of this research is to accurately detect and predict areas prone to gully erosion. In this paper, we couple hybrid models of a commonly used base classifier (reduced pruning error tree, REPTree) with AdaBoost (AB), bagging (Bag), and random subspace (RS) algorithms to create gully erosion susceptibility maps for a sub-basin of the Shoor River watershed in northwestern Iran. We compare the performance of these models in terms of their ability to predict gully erosion and discuss their potential use in other arid and semi-arid areas. Our database comprises 242 gully erosion locations, which we randomly divided into training and testing sets with a ratio of 70/30. Based on expert knowledge and analysis of aerial photographs and satellite images, we selected 12 conditioning factors for gully erosion. We used multi-collinearity statistical techniques in the modeling process, and checked model performance using statistical indexes including precision, recall, F-measure, Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC), receiver operatic characteristic curve (ROC), precision-recall graph (PRC), Kappa, root mean square error (RMSE), relative absolute error (PRSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and relative absolute error (RAE). Results show that rainfall, elevation, and river density are the most important factors for gully erosion susceptibility mapping in the study area. All three hybrid models that we tested significantly enhanced and improved the predictive power of REPTree (AUC=0.800), but the RS-REPTree (AUC= 0.860) ensemble model outperformed the Bag-REPTree (AUC= 0.841) and the AB-REPTree (AUC= 0.805) models. We suggest that decision makers, planners, and environmental engineers employ the RS-REPTree hybrid model to better manage gully erosion-prone areas in Iran.","[Viet-Ha Nhu] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City 758307, Vietnam; [Viet-Ha Nhu] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City 758307, Vietnam; [Janizadeh, Saeid; Avand, Mohammadtaghi] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Coll Nat Resources, Dept Watershed Management Engn, POB 14115-111, Tehran, Iran; [Chen, Wei] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geol & Environm, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Farzin, Mohsen] Univ Yasuj, Fac Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Forestry Range & Watershed Management, Yasuj 7591874934, Iran; [Omidvar, Ebrahim] Univ Kashan, Fac Nat Resources & Earth Sci, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Kashan 8731753153, Iran; [Shirzadi, Ataollah] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Kurdistan Studies Inst, Dept Zrebar Lake Environm Res, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Clague, John J.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Jaafari, Abolfazl] AREEO, Res Inst Forests & Rangelands, POB 64414-356, Tehran, Iran; [Mansoorypoor, Fatemeh] Univ Tehran, Coll Farabi, Dept Engn, Data Min Lab, Tehran 3718117469, Iran; [Binh Thai Pham] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Bin Ahmad, Baharin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Dept Geoinformat, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Lee, Saro] Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources KIGAM, Geosci Platform Res Div, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejeon 34132, South Korea; [Lee, Saro] Korea Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geophys Explorat, 217 Gajeong Ro, Daejeon 34113, South Korea","Pham, BT (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.; Lee, S (corresponding author), Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources KIGAM, Geosci Platform Res Div, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejeon 34132, South Korea.; Lee, S (corresponding author), Korea Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geophys Explorat, 217 Gajeong Ro, Daejeon 34113, South Korea.",nhuvietha@tdtu.edu.vn; Janizadeh.saeed@gmail.com; Mt.avand70@gmail.com; chenwei.0930@163.com; m.farzin@yu.ac.ir; ebrahimomidvar@kashanu.ac.ir; a.shirzadi@uok.ac.ir; h.shahabi@uok.ac.ir; clague@sfu.ca; jaafari@rifr-ac.ir; Fatemehmansoorypoor@gmail.com; phamthaibinh2@duytan.edu.vn; baharinahmad@utm.my; leesaro@kigam.re.kr,"avand, mohammadtaghi/AAG-6319-2019; Shirzadi, Ataollah/AAX-9800-2020; Jaafari, Abolfazl/AAG-5500-2019; Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017; ????, Wei Chen/ABB-8669-2020","avand, mohammadtaghi/0000-0001-7196-5051; Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0003-1666-1180; Farzin, Mohsen/0000-0002-6295-0701","Basic Research Project of the Korea Institute of Geoscience, Mineral Resources (KIGAM) - Minister of Science and ICT","This research was supported by the Basic Research Project of the Korea Institute of Geoscience, Mineral Resources (KIGAM) funded by the Minister of Science and ICT.",,133,23,23,6,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Therefore, the chief aim of this study is to propose efficient hybrid system by integrating Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm with Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. 130 years of monthly historical natural streamflow data will be used to evaluate the performance of the proposed modelling technique. Quantitative performance indicators will be introduced to evaluate the validity of the integrated models; in addition to that, comprehensive analysis will be conducted between the predicted and the observed streamflow.

The key novelty presented in this paper is an artificial intelligence-driven visual conversation automation method. We will present a state of the art Artificial Intelligence Snapchat Visual Conversation Agent (AISVCA). AISVCA uses our proposed artificial intelligence-driven visual conversation automation method to create received image caption and generate an appropriate reasonable visual response. These functionalities are achieved by using a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM) and, Latent Semantic Indexing method (LSI). CNN and LSTM are used to create image captions and, LSI is used to assess the semantic similarity between captions generated from personalized image dataset, and captions that are extracted from the received image content. We will show that AISVCA, using the proposed method can generate a visual response that is basically indistinguishable from a human visual response. To evaluate the proposed approach, we measured the accuracy of the proposed system and, conducted a user study to test communication quality. In the user study, we analyzed source credibility and interpersonal attraction of the AISVCA. The user study results showed that there are no significant differences in communication quality between a visual conversation with AISVCA and visual conversation with the human agent.","[Arsovski, Sasa; Cheok, Adrian David; Govindarajoo, Kirthana; Salehuddin, Nurizzaty; Vedadi, Somaiyeh] Imagineering Inst, Iskandar Puteri, Malaysia","Arsovski, S (corresponding author), Imagineering Inst, Iskandar Puteri, Malaysia.",sasa@imagineeringinstitute.org,,"Cheok, Adrian David/0000-0001-6316-2339",,,,26,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-669X,1573-7497,,APPL INTELL,Appl.

SI algorithms have demonstrated their efficacy in solving various types of real-world optimization problems. However, it is impossible to find an optimization algorithm that can obtain the global optimum for every optimization problem. Therefore, researchers extensively try to improve methods of solving complex optimization problems. Many SI search algorithms are widely applied to solve such problems. ABC is one of the most popular algorithms in solving different kinds of optimization problems. However, it has a weak local search performance where the equation of solution search in ABC performs good exploration, but poor exploitation. Besides, it has a fast convergence and can therefore be trapped in the local optima for some complex multimodal problems. In order to address such issues, this paper proposes a novel hybrid ABC with outstanding local search algorithm called beta-hill climbing (beta HC) and denoted by ABC-beta HC. The aim is to improve the exploitation mechanism of the standard ABC. The proposed algorithm was experimentally tested with parameters tuning process and validated using selected benchmark functions with different characteristics, and it was also evaluated and compared with well-known state-of-the-art algorithms. The evaluation process was investigated using different common measurement metrics. The result showed that the proposed ABC-beta HC had faster convergence in most benchmark functions and outperformed eight algorithms including the original ABC in terms of all the selected measurement metrics. For more validation, Wilcoxon's rank sum statistical test was conducted, and the p values were found to be mostly less than 0.05, which demonstrates that the superiority of the proposed ABC-beta HC is statistically significant.","[Jarrah, Muath Ibrahim; Jaya, A.

The disorder and fatal diseases can be triggered in living organisms by accumulating the heavy metals in the wastewater. Adsorption is an operative cleansing and separation method used in the industry to remove contaminants from effluents. In order to convert the rice husk to the adsorbent, digestion and carbonization processes were performed. Rice husks digested nitric acid at 1.0 M to reduce the organic constituents and further carbonized at 400, 600 and 800 degrees C to eliminate the non-carbon element in rice husks. The physiochemical characteristics of the digested and carbonized rice husks were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic adsorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The SEM morphological characteristics showed the high pyrolysis effect on the organic matter left the samples with more pores and cavities, which enhanced the surface area and uptake, especially for 800 degrees C carbonized samples. The samples' physical characteristics using XRD showed that the treatment with HNO3 illustrated a pattern close to the activated carbon with slightly lower intensities. The applied feed-forward back-propagation neural network algorithm showed high validity (R-2 approximate to 0.9686) for the tested experimental data sets and hence can be applied for forthcoming studies with nearby conditions. The outcomes showed that the increment of the carbonization temperature is correlated with the contact time and can increase the metal uptake percentage and adsorption capacity. The adsorption followed the Langmuir isotherm, which indicates monolayer coverage. The data showed that adsorption kinetics follow the pseudo-second-order rate expression.","[Ullah, Sami; Assiri, Mohammed Ali; Al-Sehemi, Abdullah G.; Irfan, Ahmad] King Khalid Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Chem, POB 9004, Abha 61413, Saudi Arabia; [Bustam, Mohamad Azmi] Univ Teknol Petronas, Dept Chem Engn, Bandar Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Kareem, Firas A.

One major shortcoming of the methane dry reforming as a potential route for renewable hydrogen-rich syngas production is catalyst deactivation through carbon deposition. In this study, an artificial neural network approach was employed for predictive modeling of the deactivation of alumina supported cobalt catalyst used to catalyze methane dry reforming reaction. The effect of methane/carbon dioxide (CH4/CO2) ratio, reaction temperature and nitrogen (N-2) flowrate on the carbon deposition were investigated using full factorial experimental design. Two artificial neural network modeling techniques namely multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) and radial basis function (RBFNN) were employed for the prediction of carbon deposition per gram catalyst using data obtained from 170 experimental runs. The hidden neurons were optimized to obtain 16 and 20 units respectively for the MLPNN and the RBFNN resulting in the network architecture of 3, 16, 1 and 3, 20,1, respectively. The statistical analysis of the network performance resulted in mean standard error (MSE) values of 0.048 and 0.00285 for training the MLPNN algorithm above and below stoichiometric conditions with corresponding R-2 values of 0.945 and 0.965. While MSE values of 0.0073 and 0.00015 were obtained for the training of the RBFNN algorithm above and below stoichiometric conditions with R-2 of 0.987 for both cases. Base on the statistical analysis the RBFNN model was adjudicated as a better predictor of the carbon deposition during the hydrogen-rich syngas production than the MLPNN model. The three input parameters were found to have varying levels of importance in the prediction of the carbon deposition. The reaction temperature was observed to be the most important parameters that influence the prediction of carbon deposition above stochiometric while CH4/CO2 was the most important parameters that influence the prediction of carbon deposition below stoichiometric conditions.

In this study, a hybrid artificial intelligence approach of random subspace (RS) meta classifier, based on the reduced error pruning tree (REPTree) base classifier, namely RS-REPTree, was proposed to predict the LSCP. A total of 122 laboratory datasets were used and portioned into training (70%: 85 cases) and validation (30%: 37 cases) datasets for modeling and validation processes, respectively. The statistical metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R), and Taylor diagram were used to check the goodness-of-fit and performance of the proposed model. The capability of this model was assessed and compared with four state-of-the-art soft-computing benchmark algorithms, including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), M5P, and REPTree, along with two empirical models, including the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) and Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 18 (HEC-18). The findings showed that machine learning algorithms had the highest goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy (0.885 < R < 0.945) in comparison to the other models. The results of sensitivity analysis by the proposed model indicated that pile cap location (Y) was a more sensitive factor for LSCP among other factors. The result also depicted that the RS-REPTree ensemble model (R = 0.945) could well enhance the prediction power of the REPTree base classifier (R = 0.885). Therefore, the proposed model can be useful as a promising technique to predict the LSCP.","[Dieu Tien Bui] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Dieu Tien Bui] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Shirzadi, Ataollah] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Amini, Ata] AREEO, Kurdistan Agr & Nat Resources Res & Educ Ctr, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Kurdistan Studies Inst, Dept Zrebar Lake Environm Res, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Al-Ansari, Nadhir] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Hamidi, Shahriar] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Agr, Dept Water Sci & Engn, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Singh, Sushant K.] Virtusa Corp, Dept Hlth Insurance & Life Sci Data & Analyti, Irvington, NJ 07111 USA; [Binh Thai Pham] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Bin Ahmad, Baharin] UTM, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Ghazvinei, Pezhman Taherei] Ale Taha Univ, Tech & Engn Coll, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran 1488836164, Iran","Al-Ansari, N (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden.",buitiendieu@tdtu.edu.vn; a.shirzadi@uok.ac.ir; ata_amini@yahoo.com; h.shahabi@uok.ac.ir; nadhir.alansari@ltu.se; shahriar133@gmail.com; sushantorama@gmail.com; phamthaibinh2@duytan.edu.vn; baharinahmad@utm.my; taherei@gmail.com,"Shirzadi, Ataollah/AAX-9800-2020; Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017; Amini, Ata/S-1629-2016; Singh, Sushant/G-5007-2015","Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0003-1666-1180; Amini, Ata/0000-0001-9358-185X; Al-Ansari, Nadhir/0000-0002-6790-2653; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0001-9668-8687; Singh, Sushant/0000-0001-6065-6050",,,,93,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2020,12,3,,,,,,,1063,10.3390/su12031063,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LB8SF,WOS:000524899601006,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

Herein, two different scenarios, scenariol (SC1) and scenariol (SC2), were investigated, with each scenario comprising a different combination of input parameters. This study proposes two artificial intelligence techniques: a rnultilayer perceptron neural network (MLP-ANN) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Furthermore, three evaluation indexes were adopted to assess the performance of the proposed models. These indexes are the correlation coefficient, root mean square error, and scatter index. The trial and error method were used to tune the hyperparameters: the number of neurons in the hidden layer, training algorithms, transfer and activation functions, and number and shape of the membership function for the proposed models. Results show that for the above mentioned three stations, the ANFIS model outperformed MLP-ANN by 0.740%, 6.23%, and 9.39%, respectively. To assess the uncertainties of the best model, ANFIS, the percentage of observed data bracketed by 95 percent predicted uncertainties (95PPUs) and the band width of 95 percent confidence intervals (d-factors) are selected. The obtained values bracketed by 95PPUs are show about 75.2%, 77.4%, 76.8% and the d-factor has a value of 0.27, 0.21 and 0.23 at Kudat, Sandakan and Kota Kinabalu stations, respectively. A comparison between the two scenarios shows that SC1 achieved a high level of accuracy on Kudat and Sandakan data, whereas SC2 outperformed SC1 on Kota Kinabalu data.","[Muslim, T.

To overcome these difficulties, a data mining-based damage identification approach is developed in this study. First four natural frequencies which obtained from the experimental modal analysis of a slab-on-girder bridge structure are used as an input database. The laboratory work is carried out through single-type and multiple-type damage scenarios. The applicability of machine learning, artificial intelligence and statistical data mining techniques are here examined using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) to predict the model behavior and damage severity. Then, a hybrid algorithm is proposed in the deployment step of Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) model. According to the obtained results, the hybrid algorithm performs a better accuracy in compare to ANN technique itself. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Hourly river flow data for the period 2011-2014 is employed for the development and evaluation of the predictive models. The performance of the ENN model in forecasting hourly stage river flow is compared with other well-established ML-based models using a number of statistical metrics and graphical evaluation methods. The ENN showed an outstanding performance in terms of their forecasting accuracies, in comparison with other ML models. In general, the results clearly advocate the ENN as a promising artificial intelligence technique for accurate forecasting of hourly river flow in the form of real-time.","[Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Naganna, Sujay Raghavendra] Shri Madhwa Vadiraja Inst Technol & Management, Dept Civil Engn, Bantakal-574115, Bantakal 574115, Udupi, India; [Sa'adi, Zulfaqar; Shahid, Shamsuddin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Skudai 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia; [Samui, Pijush] Natl Inst Technol Patna, Dept Civil Engn, Patna, Bihar, India; [Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali] Univ Tabriz, Dept Water Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali] Near East Univ, Dept Civil Engn, POB 99138, Nicosia, North Cyprus, Turkey; [Salih, Sinan Q.] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Salih, Sinan Q.] Univ Anbar, Dept Comp Sci, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Ramadi, Iraq","Salih, SQ (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.; Salih, SQ (corresponding author), Univ Anbar, Dept Comp Sci, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Ramadi, Iraq.",Sinan_salih@computer-college.org,"Salih, Sinan/F-6284-2019; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018; FKA, SHAMSUDDIN SHAHID/B-5185-2010; Naganna, Sujay/D-2871-2014","Salih, Sinan/0000-0003-0717-7506; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; FKA, SHAMSUDDIN SHAHID/0000-0001-9621-6452; Naganna, Sujay/0000-0002-0482-1936; Sa'adi, Zulfaqar/0000-0001-6875-1108",,,,48,11,11,2,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

This study aimed to evaluate and compare the prediction capability of the naive Bayes tree (NBTree), alternating decision tree (ADTree), and random forest (RF) methods for the spatial prediction of flood occurrence in the Quannan area, China. A flood inventory map with 363 flood locations was produced and partitioned into training and validation datasets through random selection with a ratio of 70/30. The spatial flood database was constructed using thirteen flood explanatory factors. The probability certainty factor (PCF) method was used to analyze the correlation between the factors and flood occurrences. Consequently, three flood susceptibility maps were produced using the NBTree, ADTree, and RF methods. Finally, the area under the curve (AUC) and statistical measures were used to validate the flood susceptibility models. The results indicated that the RF method is an efficient and reliable model in flood susceptibility assessment, with the highest AUC values, positive predictive rate, negative predictive rate, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the training (0.951, 0.892, 0.941, 0.945, 0.886, and 0.915, respectively) and validation (0.925, 0.851, 0.938, 0.945, 0.835, and 0.890, respectively) datasets.

Deep learning is broadly used for load forecasting in the smart grid using the artificial neural network (ANN). Generally, computing the deep learning in the smart grid requires massive data aggregation or centralization and significant computational time. This paper presents a survey of deep learning-based load forecasting techniques from 2015 to 2020. This survey discusses the studies based on their deep learning techniques, Distributed Deep Learning (DDL) techniques, Back Propagation (BP) based works, and non-BP based works in the load forecasting process. Consequent to the survey, it was determined that data aggregation dependency would be beneficial for reducing computational time in load forecasting.

This is due to the fact that the cloud system alone cannot sufficiently support the huge demands of future networks with the massive growth of new, time-critical applications such as self-driving vehicles, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality techniques, advanced robotics and critical remote control of smart Internet-of-Things applications. While decentralised edge computing will form the backbone of future heterogeneous networks, it still remains at its infancy stage. Currently, there is no comprehensive platform. In this article, we propose a novel decentralised edge architecture, a solution called OMNIBUS, which enables a continuous distribution of computational capacity for end-devices in different localities by exploiting moving vehicles as storage and computation resources. Scalability and adaptability are the main features that differentiate the proposed solution from existing edge computing models. The proposed solution has the potential to scale infinitely, which will lead to a significant increase in network speed. The OMNIBUS solution rests on developing two predictive models: (i) to learn timing and direction of vehicular movements to ascertain computational capacity for a given locale, and (ii) to introduce a theoretical framework for sequential to parallel conversion in learning, optimisation and caching under contingent circumstances due to vehicles in motion.","[Ergen, Mustafa; Ergen, Onur; Shayea, Ibraheem] Istanbul Tech Univ ITU, Fac Elect & Elect Engn, Elect & Commun Engn Dept, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey; [Ergen, Mustafa; Inan, Feride] Ambeent Inc, Yuba, CA 95991 USA; [Ergen, Onur] Koc Univ, Elect & Elect Engn, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey; [Tuysuz, Mehmet Fatih] Northumbria Univ, Comp & Informat Sci Dept, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England; [Azizan, Azizul] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Razak Fac Technol & Informat, Adv Informat Dept, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia; [Ure, Nazim Kemal] Istanbul Tech Univ, Artificial Intelligence & Data Sci Applicat & Res, ITU Ayazaga Campus, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey; [Nekovee, Maziar] Univ Sussex, Ctr Adv Commun Mobile Technol & IoT, Sch Engn & Informat, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England","Ergen, M (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ ITU, Fac Elect & Elect Engn, Elect & Commun Engn Dept, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey.; Ergen, M (corresponding author), Ambeent Inc, Yuba, CA 95991 USA.",mustafaergen@itu.edu.tr,"Shayea, Ibraheem/V-1563-2019; Ure, Nazim Kemal/AAD-3967-2021","Shayea, Ibraheem/0000-0003-0957-4468; Ure, Nazim Kemal/0000-0003-2660-2141; Ergen, Mustafa/0000-0003-0737-7575; Tuysuz, Mehmet Fatih/0000-0002-8955-9710; Nekovee, Maziar/0000-0001-8771-5452","Ambeent Inc.; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Research University Grant Scheme Tier 2 [PY/2019/00325]","This work was mainly supported by Ambeent Inc., and in part by the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Research University Grant Scheme Tier 2, under Grant PY/2019/00325.",,96,0,0,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,215928,215942,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3038233,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,PC7OK,WOS:000597185800001,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Accepted",,,11/3/2021

Flash floods are the main cause of the casualties and loss of properties. Existing natural disaster prediction algorithms contains false alarms. Indefinite techniques have been applied to overcome this leading issue in many countries. A competent flood management system must have the potential and tendency to identify the flash floods and atmospheric and climatic changes on early basis with less false alarm rate. Techniques which have been designed for the flash flood investigation may be categorized into following types a. Sensors based direct measurement b. Radar images c. Satellite based X-band images. The proposed research consisted of Artificial intelligence-based decision making for multi-modal sensing (direct measurement from multi-resolution sensors). A combination of sensors like Passive infrared (PIR), water level sensor, ultrasonic sensor, temperature sensor, pressure and altimeter sensors have been integrated on a single device to investigate the flash floods. The use of most suitable pair of measurement sensors can substantially enhance the advantage of more accuracy and reliability compared to a single sensor. In recent trends Particle swarm optimization is very popular for solving stochastic global optimization problems. The data was trained and processed by modified multi-layer feed forward neural network optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm. Hybrid Modified Particle swarm optimization has been combined with feed forward neural network for the vigorous investigation of flash floods with less false alarm rate. Simulated results showed that the proposed research algorithm Modified multi-layer feed forward neural network optimized by Particle swarm optimization for multi-modal sensing performed very well in terms of evaluation parameters compared to other existing strategies with minimum false alarm ratio.

In particular, brain cancer holds the least rate of survival than all other cancer types. The categorization of a brain tumor depends upon the various factors such as texture, shape and location. The medical experts have preferred the appropriate treatment to the patients, based on the accurate identification of tumor type. The process of segmenting the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has high complicacy during the analysis of brain tumor, owing to its variable shape, location, size, and texture. The physicians and radiologists can easily detect and categorize the tumors if there exists a system by combining Computer Assisted Diagnosis (CAD) as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI). An approach of automated segmentation has proposed in this paper, which enables the segmentation of tumor out of MRI images, besides enhances the efficiency of segmentation and classification. The initial functions of this approach include preprocessing and segmentation processes for segmenting tumor or tissue of benign and malignant by expanding a range of data and clustering. A modern learning-based approach has suggested in this study, in order to process the automated segmentation in multimodal MRI images to identify brain tumor, hence the clustering algorithm of Bat Algorithm with Fuzzy C-Ordered Means (BAFCOM) has recommended segmenting the tumor. The Bat Algorithm calculates the initial centroids and distance within the pixels in the clustering algorithm of BAFCOM, which also acquires the tumor through determining the distance among tumor Region of Interest (RoI) and non-tumor RoI. Afterwards, the MRI image has analyzed by the Enhanced Capsule Networks (ECN) method to categorize it as normal and brain tumor. Ultimately, the algorithm of ECN has assessed the performance of proposed approach by distinguishing the two categories of the tumor over MRI images, besides the suggested ECN classifier has assessed by the measurement factors of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. In addition, the genetic algorithm has applied to process the automatic tumor stage classification, which in turn classification accuracy enhanced.","[Alhassan, Afnan M.; Zainon, Wan Mohd Nazmee Wan] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Alhassan, Afnan M.] Shaqra Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Technol, Shaqra 11961, Saudi Arabia","Alhassan, AM (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia.; Alhassan, AM (corresponding author), Shaqra Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Technol, Shaqra 11961, Saudi Arabia.",aalhassan@su.edu.sa,,,,,,38,0,0,1,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,201741,201751,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3035803,,,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,OS8UJ,WOS:000590433500001,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

Western countries have been enjoying the privilege of spoken language recognition-based applications for a while now, however, they have not gained much popularity in multi-lingual countries like India owing to various complexities. In this paper, we have addressed this issue by attempting to identify different Indian languages based on various well-known features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC), Linear Prediction Coefficient (LPC), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (GFCC) as well as a few deep learning architecture based features like i-vector and x-vector extracted from the audio signals. After comparing the initial results, it is observed that the combination of MFCC and LPC produces the best results. Then we have developed a new nature-inspired feature selection (FS) algorithm by hybridizing Binary Bat Algorithm (BBA) with Late Acceptance Hill-Climbing (LAHC) to select the optimal subset from the said feature vectors in order to reduce the model complexity and help it train faster. Using Random Forest (RF) classifier, we have achieved an accuracy of 92.35% on Indic TTS database developed by IIT-Madras, and an accuracy of 100% on the Indic Speech database developed by the Speech and Vision Laboratory (SVL) IIIT-Hyderabad.

It is widely studied as it has a significant effect on employees, customers, management, stockholders, bank lending assessments, and profitability. In recent years, machine learning techniques, particularly Artificial Neural Network (ANN), have widely been studied for bankruptcy prediction since they have proven to be a good predictor, especially in financial applications. A critical process in learning a network is weight training. Although the ANN is mathematically efficient, it has a complex weight training process, especially in computation time when involving a large training data. Many studies improved ANN's weight training using metaheuristic algorithms such as Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), and Swarm Intelligence (SI) approaches for bankruptcy prediction. In this study, two metaheuristics algorithms, Magnetic Optimization Algorithm (MOA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), have been enhanced through hybridization to propose a new method MOA-PSO. Hybrid algorithms have been proven to be capable of solving optimization problems faster, with better accuracy. The MOA-PSO was used in training ANN to improve the performance of the ANN in bankruptcy prediction. The performance of the hybrid MOA-PSO was compared with that of four existing algorithms.

Consequently, communications service providers should deploy efficient and intelligent network solutions to accommodate the huge traffic demands and to ease the capacity pressure on their network infrastructure. Besides, vendors should develop novel energy-efficient networks to reduce network utility costs and carbon footprint. Software-defined networking (SDN) provides a suitable solution, however, complete SDN deployment is currently unachievable in the short-term. An alternative is the hybrid SDN/ open shortest path forwarding (OSPF) network, which allows the deployment of SDN in legacy networks. Nevertheless, hybrid SDN/OSPF also faces several technical, economic and organizational challenges. Although many energy-efficiency routing solutions exist in hybrid SDN/OSPF networks, they are generic and reactive by design. Moreover, these solutions are characterized by manual control plane forwarding configurations, leading to sub-optimal performance. The recent promising combination of SDN and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in traffic management and control provides tremendous opportunities. In this paper, we first provide a review of the most recent optimization approaches for global energy-efficient routing and load balancing. Next, we investigate a scalable and intelligent integrated architectural framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to realize predictive and rate adaptive energy-efficient routing with guaranteed quality of service (QoS), in transitional hybrid SDN/OSPF networks. Based on the need to minimize global network energy consumption and improve link performance, this paper provides key research insights into the current progress in hybrid SDN/OSPF, ML and AI in the hope of stimulating more research.","[Etengu, Richard; Tan, Saw Chin] Multimedia Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Cyberjaya 63100, Malaysia; [Kwang, Lee Ching; Chuah, Teong Chee] Multimedia Univ, Fac Engn, Cyberjaya 63100, Malaysia; [Abbou, Fouad Mohammed] Al Akhawayn Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, Ifrane 53000, Morocco","Etengu, R (corresponding author), Multimedia Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Cyberjaya 63100, Malaysia.",etengur@yahoo.com,,"Etengu, Richard/0000-0002-7312-5678","Ministry of Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/MMU01/1]; Research Grant of TM Research and Development and Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Malaysia","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Education Malaysia under Grant FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/MMU01/1, and in part by the Research Grant of TM Research and Development and Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Malaysia.",,155,0,0,2,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,166384,166441,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3022291,,,58,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,NT5TR,WOS:000573003600001,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

The second scenario employed a hybrid random forest (RF) ensemble in order to enhance the prediction accuracy of the single models. The WQ parameters were subjected to a different pre-analysis test to ascertain their stability. The four-model combinations are generated using the nonlinear sensitivity input selection approach. The modeling performance was assessed using the statistical measures of Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient efficiency (NSE), Willmott's index of agreement (WI), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) and correlation coefficient (CC). The results of the single AI-based models demonstrated that HW (M3) served as the best model for predicting DO concentration. For ensemble results, BPNN-E (WI = 0.9764) was superior to the other three ET with average decreased of more than 2% with regards to MAE. Investigation on the hybrid RF ensemble demonstrated the reliable accuracy for all the hybrid models with better predictive skill shown by the HW-RF (CC = 0.981) ensemble. The overall results verified the promising impact of HW-M3, ET and hybrid RF ensemble for the prediction of the DO concentration in the Kinta River, Malaysia.","[Abba, Sani Isah] Yusuf Maitama Sule Univ, Dept Phys Planning Dev, Kano 700221, Nigeria; [Linh, Nguyen Thi Thuy] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Danang 550000, Vietnam; [Linh, Nguyen Thi Thuy] Duy Tan Univ, Fac Environm & Chem Engn, Danang 550000, Vietnam; [Abdullahi, Jazuli; Ali, Shaban Ismael Albrka] Near East Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, CY-99138 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Ali, Shaban Ismael Albrka] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Sustainable Urban Transport Res Ctr SUTRA, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Pham, Quoc Bao] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Environm Qual Atmospher Sci & Climate Change Res, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Pham, Quoc Bao] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Abdulkadir, Rabiu Aliyu] Kano Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Wudil 713101, Nigeria; [Costache, Romulus] Univ Bucharest, Res Inst, Bucharest 050663, Romania; [Costache, Romulus] Natl Inst Hydrol & Water Management, Bucharest 013686, Romania; [Nam, Van Thai; Anh, Duong Tran] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol HUTECH, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam","Pham, QB (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Environm Qual Atmospher Sci & Climate Change Res, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam.; Pham, QB (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam.",phambaoquoc@tdtu.edu.vn,"Costache, Romulus/O-2843-2019; Pham, Quoc Bao/AAD-5611-2020; Abdulkadir, Rabiu Aliyu/AAY-6305-2020; Anh, Duong Tran/M-6789-2019; Abba, Sani Isah/C-8573-2017","Costache, Romulus/0000-0002-6876-8572; Pham, Quoc Bao/0000-0002-0468-5962; Abdulkadir, Rabiu Aliyu/0000-0002-5815-6679; Anh, Duong Tran/0000-0002-6775-0055; Abba, Sani Isah/0000-0001-9356-2798",,,,76,1,1,2,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,157218,157237,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3017743,,,20,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,NM7KP,WOS:000568273700001,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

The conventional FA use randomization factor during generation of solution search space and fireflies position changing, which results in imbalanced relationship between exploration and exploitation. This imbalanced relationship causes in incapability of FA to find the most optimum values at termination stage. In the proposed model, this issue has been resolved by incorporating PS at the termination stage of standard FA. The optimized values obtained from the FA are set as the initial starting points for the PS algorithm and the values are further optimized by PS to get the most optimal values or at least better values than the values obtained by conventional FA during its maximum number of iterations. The performance of the newly developed FA-PS model has been tested on eight minimization functions and six maximization functions by considering various performance evaluation parameters. The results obtained have been compared with other optimization algorithms namely genetic algorithm (GA), standard FA, artificial bee colony (ABC), ant colony optimization (ACO), differential equations (DE), bat algorithm (BA), grey wolf optimization (GWO), Self-Adaptive Step Firefly Algorithm (SASFA), and FA-Cross algorithm in terms of convergence rate and various numerical performance evaluation parameters. A significant improvement has been observed in the solution quality by embedding PS in the standard FA at the termination stage. The result behind this improvement is the better exploration and exploitation of the solution search space at this stage.","[Wahid, Fazli] Univ Haripur, Dept Informat Technol, Haripur 22620, Pakistan; [Zia, M.

With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the traditional waste management system can be replaced with smart sensors embedded into the system to perform real time monitoring and allow for better waste management. The aim of this research is to develop a smart waste management system using LoRa communication protocol and TensorFlow based deep learning model. LoRa sends the sensor data and Tensorflow performs real time object detection and classification. The bin consists of several compartments to segregate the waste including metal, plastic, paper, and general waste compartment which are controlled by the servo motors. Object detection and waste classification is done in TensorFlow framework with pre-trained object detection model. This object detection model is trained with images of waste to generate a frozen inference graph used for object detection which is done through a camera connected to the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ as the main processing unit. Ultrasonic sensor is embedded into each waste compartment to monitor the filling level of the waste. GPS module is integrated to monitor the location and real time of the bin.

The proposed intelligent control approach incorporates a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and an intelligent active force control (IAFC) element yielding a robust PID-IAFC scheme. A detailed mathematical model of a quadrotor system with six degrees of freedom (DOFs) was first derived using the Newton-Euler method taking into consideration the gyroscopic terms, disturbances, aerodynamics, and friction effects. In the derived model, the PID controller was first designed to stabilize the quadrotor model and achieve the required altitude and attitude motions. In addition, different types of external disturbances in the form of sinusoidal waves and repeated impulses (pulsating) were added. An AFC strategy, known as PID-AFC, was designed and incorporated into the PID controller, and was initially tuned heuristically. Then, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based method employing an iterative learning (IL) algorithm was designed and implemented into the AFC (ILAFC) to estimate the control parameters automatically while on-line. Thereafter, the performance of the ILAFC was compared to the AFC with fuzzy logic (FL) which became known as FLAFC. Also, a self-tuning (ST) PID controller was designed and employed based on the FL method to automatically tune the PID gains based on the prescribed operating and loading conditions. Moreover, a comparative study of the system performance was carried out utilizing the PID, PID-AFC, ILAFC, FLAFC, and ST-FPID-AFC schemes to analyze the system characteristics. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the AFC-based intelligent controller was investigated in connection with the body jerk performance in the presence of external disturbances. The simulated results reveal the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategy based on the IAFC technique in improving the disturbance rejection capability and body jerk performance by 17% in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances.","[Abdelmaksoud, Sherif I.; Mailah, Musa] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Mech Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Abdallah, Ayman M.] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Aerosp Engn Dept, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia","Abdelmaksoud, SI (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Mech Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia.",iasherif@graduate.utm.my,"Abdelmaksoud, Sherif I./AAP-4002-2020","Mailah, Musa/0000-0001-6929-5597; Abdelmaksoud, sherif I./0000-0001-5455-5843",,,,33,4,4,3,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,150037,150050,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3015101,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,ND7HY,WOS:000562075200001,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

Existing countermeasures in the form of anti-phishing software and computational methods for detecting phishing activities have proven to be effective. However, new methods are deployed by hackers to thwart these countermeasures. Due to the evolving nature of phishing attacks, the need for novel and efficient countermeasures becomes crucial as the effect of phishing attacks are often fatal and disastrous. Artificial Intelligence (AI) schemes have been the cornerstone of modern countermeasures used for mitigating phishing attacks. AI-based phishing countermeasures or methods possess their shortcomings particularly the high false alarm rate and the inability to interpret how most phishing methods perform their function. This study proposed four (4) meta-learner models (AdaBoost-Extra Tree (ABET), Bagging - Extra tree (BET), Rotation Forest - Extra Tree (RoFBET) and LogitBoost-Extra Tree (LBET)) developed using the extra-tree base classifier. The proposed AI-based meta-learners were fitted on phishing website datasets (currently with the newest features) and their performances were evaluated. The models achieved a detection accuracy not lower than 97% with a drastically low false-positive rate of not more 0.028. In addition, the proposed models outperform existing ML-based models in phishing attack detection.

With the advent of deep learning-based machine learning in artificial intelligence, this imaginary idea has become part of our life. Like in other fields, these technological revolutions have brought drastic changes to the field of automated driving systems. The autonomous vehicle is in the transition state between level 3 and level 4 of automation, but many mysteries are still waiting to be solved. Understanding the environment as precisely as a human driver is still far in the future. To attain human perception requires the capturing of extensive surrounding information that depends on the onboard sensors installed on the vehicle. Because the recent autonomous vehicle is equipped with several sensors, it captures surrounding information in diverse forms. Combining these multi-domain data with sensor fusion is the open area of research that is considered in this paper. Along with sensor fusion, another area of prime importance that is necessary to be explored is the prediction of pedestrian intentions. Though the study of the prediction of a pedestrian's intentions started approximately fifteen years ago, most of the research is based on detection rather than intention. Furthermore, this paper also discusses related research in the field of prediction of the pedestrian's intentions.

Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. This would be extremely useful in this pandemic where disease burden and need for preventive measures are at odds with available resources.","[Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

Eighty-five individuals from varying educational backgrounds have participated in this study. Resting electroencephalogram (EEG) is recorded from the left prefrontal cortex using NeuroSky. Control groups are established using Kolb's Learning Style Inventory (LSI) and a model developed based on Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). Subsequently, theta, alpha and beta power ratio is extracted from the pre-processed EEG. Distribution and pattern of features show a correlation with the Neural Efficiency Hypothesis of intelligence and Alpha Suppression Theory. The power ratio features are then used to train, validate and test the ANN model. The system has demonstrated satisfactory performance for IQ classification with accuracies of 98.3% for training and 94.7% for testing. The proposed model is also able to classify learning style with accuracies of 96.9% for training and 80.0% for testing.","[Anoor, Muhammad Marwan; Jahidin, Aisyah Hartini] Univ Malaya, Ctr Fdn Studies Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Arof, Hamzah] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Megat, Megat Syahirul Amin] Univ Teknol MARA, Microwave Res Inst, Shah Alam, Malaysia; [Megat, Megat Syahirul Amin] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Elect Engn, Shah Alam, Malaysia","Megat, MSA (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA, Shah Alam 40450, Malaysia.",megatsyahirul@uitm.edu.my,"AROF, HAMZAH/ABI-1052-2020",,"Centre for Foundation Studies in Science, University of Malaya [BK035-2016]; Institute of Research Management Innovation [600-IRMI 5/3/LESTARI (032/2019)]; Institute of Quality & Knowledge Advancement, Universiti Teknologi MARA","This work is funded by the Centre for Foundation Studies in Science, University of Malaya (BK035-2016), Institute of Research Management & Innovation (600-IRMI 5/3/LESTARI (032/2019)), and Institute of Quality & Knowledge Advancement, Universiti Teknologi MARA.",,55,0,0,2,5,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1064-1246,1875-8967,,J INTELL FUZZY SYST,J.

Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) techniques, generally used for WS modelling are not only less cost-effective but also poor in predicting in shorter time horizon. Novel WS prediction models based on the multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD), random forest (RF) and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) were constructed in this paper better accuracy in WS prediction. Particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) was employed to optimize the parameters of the hybridized MEMD model with RF (MEMD-PSO-RF) and KRR (MEMD-PSO-KRR) models. Obtained results were compared to those of the standalone RF and KRR models. The proposed methodology is applied for monthly WS prediction at meteorological stations of Iraq, Baghdad (Station<sub>1</sub>) and Mosul (Station<sub>2</sub>) for the period 1977-2013. Results showed higher accuracy of MEMD-PSO-RF model in predicting WS at both stations with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.972 and r & x003D; 0.971 during testing phase at Station<sub>1</sub> and Station<sub>2</sub>, respectively. The MEMD-PSO-KRR was found as the second most accurate model followed by Standalone RF and KRR, but all showed a competitive performance to the MEMD-PSO-RF model. The outcomes of this work indicated that the MEMD-PSO-RF model has a remarkable performance in predicting WS and can be considered for practical applications.","[Tao, Hai] Baoji Univ Arts & Sci, Comp Sci Dept, Baoji, Peoples R China; [Salih, Sinan Q.] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Salih, Sinan Q.] Univ Anbar, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Comp Sci Dept, Ramadi, Iraq; [Saggi, Mandeep Kaur] Thapar Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Patiala 147004, Punjab, India; [Dodangeh, Esmaeel] Sari Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ, Dept Watershed Management, Sari 4818168984, Iran; [Voyant, Cyril] Univ Corsica, SPE Lab, UMR 6134, F-20000 Ajaccio, France; [Al-Ansari, Nadhir] Lulea Univ Technol, Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Shahid, Shamsuddin] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia","Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",yaseen@tdtu.edu.vn,"Saggi, Mandeep/ABI-4341-2020; FKA, SHAMSUDDIN SHAHID/B-5185-2010; Salih, Sinan/F-6284-2019; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018; Voyant, Cyril/AAH-9025-2019","FKA, SHAMSUDDIN SHAHID/0000-0001-9621-6452; Salih, Sinan/0000-0003-0717-7506; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; Voyant, Cyril/0000-0003-0242-7377; Al-Ansari, Nadhir/0000-0002-6790-2653",Key Research and Development Program in Shaanxi Province [2020GY-078],This work was supported by the Key Research and Development Program in Shaanxi Province under Grant 2020GY-078.,,77,5,5,4,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,83347,83358,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2990439,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,ML5JL,WOS:000549502200136,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

The study delimits itself around the road vehicle-train collisions at unmanned railway level crossings on single line rail-road sections. The first objective of the study revolves around the rail-road collision risk evaluation by the development of road vehicle-train collision frequency and severity prediction model using Poisson and Gamma-log regression techniques respectively. Another study objective is the collision modification factor implementation on predicted risk factors, to reduce the road vehicle-train collision risk at the crossings. The collision risk has been predicted to be 3.52 times higher and 77% lower in one direction while in other directions it is 2.95 times higher and 80% lower than average risk at all unmanned railway level crossings. With collision modification factor application on higher risk contributing factors i.e. 'crossing angle' and 'train visibility, it predicts to reduce the road vehicle-train collision risk to 85% approximately.","[Singhal, Vivek] JSS Acad Tech Educ, Dept Informat Technol, Noida 201301, India; [Jain, S.

Different assistive technologies are used to improve the physical and mental health of the affected patients. Exoskeletons have emerged as one of the most promising technology to provide movement and rehabilitation for the paralyzed. But exoskeletons are limited by the constraints of weight, flexibility, and adaptability. To resolve these issues, we propose an adaptive and flexible Brain Energized Full Body Exoskeleton (BFBE) for assisting the paralyzed people. This paper describes the design, control, and testing of BFBE with 15 degrees of freedom (DoF) for assisting the users in their daily activities. The flexibility is incorporated into the system by a modular design approach. The brain signals captured by the Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors are used for controlling the movements of BFBE. The processing happens at the edge, reducing delay in decision making and the system is further integrated with an IoT module that helps to send an alert message to multiple caregivers in case of an emergency. The potential energy harvesting is used in the system to solve the power issues related to the exoskeleton. The stability in the gait cycle is ensured by using adaptive sensory feedback. The system validation is done by using six natural movements on ten different paralyzed persons. The system recognizes human intensions with an accuracy of 85%. The result shows that BFBE can be an efficient method for providing assistance and rehabilitation for paralyzed patients.","[Jacob, Sunil] Lincoln Univ Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Petaling Jaya 47301, Malaysia; [Jacob, Sunil] SCMS Sch Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Ernakulam 683576, India; [Alagirisamy, Mukil] Lincoln Univ Coll, Dept Elect & Elect & Engn, Petaling Jaya 47301, Malaysia; [Menon, Varun G.] SCMS Sch Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Ernakulam 683576, India; [Kumar, B.

According to the Department of Environment (DOE, Malaysia), WQI is chiefly affected by six factors, which are, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), suspended solids (SS), -potential for hydrogen (pH), and ammoniacal nitrogen (AN). In fact, understanding the inter-relationships between these variables and WQI can improve predicting the WQI for better water resources management. The aim of this study is to create an input approach using ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks) to compute the WQI from input parameters instead of using the indices of the parameters when one of the parameters is absent. The data are collected from the nine water quality monitoring stations at the Klang River basin, Malaysia. In addition, comprehensive sensitivity analysis has been carried out to identify the most influential input parameters. The model is based on the frequency distribution of the significant factors showed exceptional ability to replicate the WQI and attained very high correlation (98.78%). Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis showed that the most influential parameter that affects WQI is DO, while pH is the least one. Additionally, the performance of models shows that the missing DO values caused deterioration in the accuracy.","[Othman, Faridah; El-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Alaaeldin, M.

Reputation represents the network-wide belief or perception of the trustworthiness of an entity. Each entity computes and assigns a trust or reputation value, which increases and decreases with the appropriateness of actions and reactions, to another entity in order to ensure a healthy collaborative relationship. Trust and reputation management (TRM) has been investigated to improve the security of traditional networks, particularly the access networks. In 5G, the access networks are multi-hop networks formed by entities which may not be trustable, and so such networks are prone to attacks, such as Sybil and crude attacks. TRM addresses such attacks to enhance the overall network performance, including reliability, scalability, and stability. Nevertheless, the investigation of TRM in 5G, which is the next-generation wireless networks, is still at its infancy. TRM must cater for the characteristics of 5G. Firstly, ultra-densification due to the exponential growth of mobile users and data traffic. Secondly, high heterogeneity due to the different characteristics of mobile users, such as different transmission characteristics (e.g., different transmission power) and different user equipment (e.g., laptops and smartphones). Thirdly, high variability due to the dynamicity of the entities' behaviors and operating environment. TRM must also cater for the core features of 5G (e.g., millimeter wave transmission, and device-to-device communication) and the core technologies of 5G (e.g., massive MIMO and beamforming, and network virtualization). In this paper, a review of TRM schemes in 5G and traditional networks, which can be leveraged to 5G, is presented. We also provide an insight on some of the important open issues and vulnerabilities in 5G networks that can be resolved using a TRM framework.","[Ahmad, Israr; Yau, Kok-Lim Alvin; Ling, Mee Hong] Sunway Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Subang Jaya 47500, Malaysia; [Keoh, Sye Loong] Univ Glasgow, Sch Comp Sci, Glasgow G12 8RZ, Lanark, Scotland","Yau, KLA (corresponding author), Sunway Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Subang Jaya 47500, Malaysia.",koklimy@sunway.edu.my,"Keoh, Sye Loong/ABH-1430-2020; Yau, Kok Lim/B-1672-2012","Keoh, Sye Loong/0000-0003-3640-5010; Yau, Kok Lim/0000-0003-3110-2782; Ahmad, Israr/0000-0002-2372-0890; Ling, Mee Hong/0000-0002-8273-458X",Malaysian Ministry of Education under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [FRGS/1/2019/ICT03/SYUC/01/1],This work was supported by the Malaysian Ministry of Education under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme through the part of the Project A Novel Clustering Algorithm based on Reinforcement Learning for the Optimization of Global and Local Network Performances in Mobile Networks'' under Grant FRGS/1/2019/ICT03/SYUC/01/1.,,59,0,0,3,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,62542,62560,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2984318,,,19,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,LH3NV,WOS:000528695000021,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Accepted",,,11/3/2021

The interconnected HPS model consists of conventional and renewable energy sources operating in disparate combinations to balance the generation and load demand of the system. In the proffered work, the stability analysis of nonlinear dynamic HPS model was analyzed using the Hankel method of model order reduction. Also, an attempt was made to apply cascade proportional integral & x2013; proportional derivative (PI-PD) control for HPS. The gains of the controller were optimized by minimizing the integral absolute error (IAE) of area control error using particle swarm optimization & x2013;gravitational search algorithm (PSO-GSA) optimization technique. The performance of cascade control was compared with other classical controllers and the efficiency of this approach was studied for various cases of HPS model. The result shows that the cascade control produced better transient and steady state performances than those of the other classical controllers. The robustness analysis also reveals that the system overshoots/undershoots in frequency response pertaining to random change in wind power generation and load perturbations were significantly reduced by the proposed cascade control.

Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is expected to be the key role player in reducing road casualties and traffic congestion. To ensure this role, a gigantic amount of data should be exchanged. However, current allocated wireless access for VANET is inadequate to handle such massive data amounts. Therefore, VANET faces a spectrum scarcity issue. Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising solution to overcome such an issue. CR-based VANET or CR-VANET must achieve several performance enhancement measures, including ultra-reliable and low-latency communication. ML methods can be integrated with CR-VANET to make CR-VANET highly intelligent, achieve rapid adaptability to the dynamicity of the environment, and improve the quality of service in an energy-efficient manner. This paper presents an overview of ML, CR, VANET, and CR-VANET, including their architectures, functions, challenges, and open issues. The applications and roles of ML methods in CR-VANET scenarios are reviewed. Insights into the use of ML for autonomous or driver-less vehicles are also presented. Current advancements in the amalgamation of these prominent technologies and future research directions are discussed.","[Hossain, Mohammad Asif; Noor, Rafidah Md.; Azzuhri, Saaidal Razalli; Z'aba, Muhammad Reza; Ahmedy, Ismail] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Yau, Kok-Lim Alvin] Sunway Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Subang Jaya 47500, Malaysia; [Noor, Rafidah Md.] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Ctr Mobile Cloud Comp, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Noor, RM (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.; Noor, RM (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Ctr Mobile Cloud Comp, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",fidah@um.edu.my,"Ahmedy, Ismail/B-8670-2010; Noor, Rafidah Md/B-5445-2010; BIN AZZUHRI, SAAIDAL RAZALLI/B-9654-2010; Z'aba, Muhammad Reza/N-4195-2017; Hossain, Mohammad Asif/AAG-5073-2021; Yau, Kok Lim/B-1672-2012","Ahmedy, Ismail/0000-0003-4324-8965; Noor, Rafidah Md/0000-0001-6266-2390; BIN AZZUHRI, SAAIDAL RAZALLI/0000-0001-8603-8840; Z'aba, Muhammad Reza/0000-0003-4908-7816; Hossain, Mohammad Asif/0000-0002-8685-3113; Yau, Kok Lim/0000-0003-3110-2782","Sunway University [CR-UM-SST-DCIS-2018-01, RK004-2017]; University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [CR-UM-SST-DCIS-2018-01, RK004-2017]",This work was supported by the Partnership Grant between Sunway University and the University of Malaya under Grant CR-UM-SST-DCIS-2018-01 and Grant RK004-2017.,,342,5,5,7,7,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,78054,78108,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2989870,,,55,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,LL9WP,WOS:000531906600032,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

Despite several analyzing methods for modeling the slimming estimation in terms of reduction in anthropometric indices, there are still weaknesses of these models such as being very demanding including time taken for analysis and accuracy. Objectives: This research proposes a novel approach for determining the slimming effect of a herbal composition as a natural medicine for weight loss. Methods: To build an effective prediction model, a modern hybrid approach, merging adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system and particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO) was constructed for prediction of changes in anthropometric indices including waist circumference, waist to hip ratio, thigh circumference and mid-upper arm circumference, on female athletes after consumption of caraway extract during ninety days clinical trial. Results: The outcomes showed that caraway extract intake was effective on lowering all anthropometric indices in female athletes after ninety days trial. The results of analysis by ANFIS-PSO was more accurate compared to SPSS. Also, the efficiency of the proposed approach was confirmed using the existing data. Conclusion: It is concluded that a development in predictive accuracy and simplification capability could be attained by hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy techniques as modern approaches in detecting changes in body characteristics.

Speaker identification technologies are widely applied in voice authentication, security and surveillance, electronic voice eavesdropping, and identity verification. In the speaker identification process, extracting discriminative and salient features from speaker utterances is an important task to accurately identify speakers. Various features for speaker identification have been recently proposed by researchers. Most studies on speaker identification have utilized short-time features, such as perceptual linear predictive (PLP) coefficients and Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), due to their capability to capture the repetitive nature and efficiency of signals. Various studies have shown the effectiveness of MFCC features in correctly identifying speakers. However, the performances of these features degrade on complex speech datasets, and therefore, these features fail to accurately identify speaker characteristics. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel fusion of MFCC and time-based features (MFCCT), which combines the effectiveness of MFCC and time-domain features to improve the accuracy of text-independent speaker identification (SI) systems. The extracted MFCCT features were fed as input to a deep neural network (DNN) to construct the speaker identification model. Results showed that the proposed MFCCT features coupled with DNN outperformed existing baseline MFCC and time-domain features on the LibriSpeech dataset. In addition, DNN obtained better classification results compared with five machine learning algorithms that were recently utilized in speaker recognition. Moreover, this study evaluated the effectiveness of one-level and two-level classification methods for speaker identification. The experimental results showed that two-level classification presented better results than one-level classification. The proposed features and classification model for identifying a speaker can be widely applied to different types of speaker datasets.","[Jahangir, Rashid; TEh, Ying Wah; Ishtiaq, Uzair; Ali, Ihsan] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Jahangir, Rashid; Ishtiaq, Uzair; Akhtar, Muhammad Zaheer] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Comp Sci, Vehari Campus, Vehari 61100, Pakistan; [Memon, Nisar Ahmed] King Faisal Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Al Hasa 31982, Saudi Arabia; [Mujtaba, Ghulam] Sukkur IBA Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ctr Excellence Robot Artificial Intelligence & Bl, Sukkur 65200, Pakistan; [Zareei, Mahdi] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Zapopan 45138, Mexico","Jahangir, R; TEh, YW; Ali, I (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.; Jahangir, R (corresponding author), COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Comp Sci, Vehari Campus, Vehari 61100, Pakistan.",rashid@siswa.um.edu.my; tehyw@um.edu.my; ihsanalichd@siswa.um.edu.my,"Teh, Ying Wah/ABD-6534-2020; Ali, Ihsan/N-7890-2014; Zareei/D-8043-2013","Teh, Ying Wah/0000-0002-3202-7035; Ali, Ihsan/0000-0002-9549-2540; Zareei/0000-0001-6623-1758; JAHANGIR, RASHID/0000-0003-1129-6006; Ishtiaq, Uzair/0000-0002-3006-8132","Ministry of Higher Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [FRGS-FP111-2018A]; University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [PG035-2016A]","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under Grant FRGS-FP111-2018A, and in part by the University of Malaya under Postgraduate Research Grant under Grant PG035-2016A.",,60,2,2,3,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,32187,32202,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973541,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,LC6CT,WOS:000525419100031,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

Five input parameters including wall height, wall thickness, soil friction angle, soil density, and stone cement mixture density were varied and 2000 cases were considered in developing the predictive models. Using the artificial neural network (ANN) method, eight prediction models were developed and evaluated based on the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error. R-2 values of 0.9740 and 0.9824 for training and testing datasets, respectively (for the best model), indicate the level of ANN capability in predicting safety factor (SF) of retaining walls. After developing the ANN model, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm was used to maximize the safety factor of the wall by varying the input parameters. In fact, the best ANN model was selected to be used as a modeling function in ACO algorithm. The SF result from optimization section was obtained as 3.057 which show a significant difference from the mean SF values used in the modeling.

However, injecting these RES into the current power system network causes large voltage and power overshoots hence deteriorate the transient response and power quality of the overall power system. In this paper, an efficient solution of the above-mentioned issues is explored by developing an optimal microgrid (MG) controller using one of the most modern and intelligent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques named the salp swarm optimization algorithm (SSA). The intelligence of the SSA is exploited to select the optimal controller gains and dc-link capacitance value by minimizing a time integrating error fitness function (FF) which in-turn enhances the dynamic response and power quality of the studied MG system. The proposed grid-tied MG controller is designed to achieve the preset active and reactive power sharing ratio between distributed generator (DG) and utility grid during DG and load switching conditions. To validate the superiority of the proposed controller, its performance is compared with that of its precedent grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA)-based controller for the identical operating conditions and system configuration. The outcomes of the study show that the proposed MG controller outperforms its competitor in terms of transient response and quality of power.","[Jumani, Touqeer Ahmed; Memon, Zeeshan Anjum] Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, SZAB Campus, Khairpur Mirs, Pakistan; [Jumani, Touqeer Ahmed; Mustafa, Mohd Wazir; Rasid, Madihah Md; Memon, Zeeshan Anjum] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Elect Engn, Skudai, Johor Bahru, Malaysia","Jumani, TA (corresponding author), Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, SZAB Campus, Khairpur Mirs, Pakistan.",atouqeer2@graduate.utm.my,"Jumani, Touqeer/AAV-1750-2020; Rasid, Madihah Md/AAV-1309-2020","Jumani, Touqeer/0000-0002-5201-5111","Ministry of Higher Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [FRGS 5F062]","Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia, Grant/Award Number: FRGS 5F062",,30,8,8,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2050-7038,,,INT T ELECTR ENERGY,Int.

Development of landslide susceptibility maps is one of the main steps in landslide management. In this study, the main objective is to develop GIS based hybrid computational intelligence models to generate landslide susceptibility maps of the Da Lat province, which is one of the landslide prone regions of Vietnam. Novel hybrid models of alternating decision trees (ADT) with various ensemble methods, namely bagging, dagging, MultiBoostAB, and RealAdaBoost, were developed namely B-ADT, D-ADT, MBAB-ADT, RAB-ADT, respectively. Data of 72 past landslide events was used in conjunction with 11 landslide conditioning factors (curvature, distance from geological boundaries, elevation, land use, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), relief amplitude, stream density, slope, lithology, weathering crust and soil) in the development and validation of the models. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and several statistical measures were applied to validate these models. Results indicated that performance of all the models was good (AUC value greater than 0.8) but B-ADT model performed the best (AUC = 0.856). Landslide susceptibility maps generated using the proposed models would be helpful to decision makers in the risk management for land use planning and infrastructure development.","[Viet-Tien Nguyen; Trong Hien Tran; Ngoc Anh Ha; Van Phong Tran] Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Inst Geol Sci, 84 Chua Lang, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Viet-Tien Nguyen] Grad Univ Sci & Technol, Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Van Liem Ngo; Huu Duy Nguyen] Vietnam Natl Univ, VNU Univ Sci, Fac Geog, 334 Nguyen Trai, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Nadhir, Al-Ansari] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, S-95187 Lulea, Sweden; [Malek, M.

Despite its negative impact to agricultural activity and water resources management, drought is still a poorly comprehended calamity, primarily due to the difficulties ascertaning its onset. Effective drought prediction is important for any development of a sustainable natural environment. This study discusses the wavelet-boosting-support vector regression (W-BS-SVR), multi-input wavelet-fuzzy-support vector regression (multi-input W-F-SVR) and weighted wavelet-fuzzy-support vector regression (weighted W-F-SVR) models for meteorological drought predictions, at the downstream of the Langat River Basin; with lead times of 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Drought severity is described by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Indices (SPEIs) with different timescales of 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively, known as SPEI-1, SPEI-3, and SPEI-6. The observed SPEIs from 1976 to 2007 were used for model training, while the SPEIs from 2008 to 2015 were for model validation. The root-mean-square-error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and adjusted R-2 were applied to assess the performance of models. In general, it was found that the fuzzy-based hybrid model, the weighted W-F-SVR predicted well for SPEI-1, SPEI-3, and SPEI-6 cases, with lead times of 3 and 6 months. As for the 1-month lead time predictions, the models' performances were dominated by the temporal variation in the SPEIs, where the weighted W-F-SVR that is capable in reducing outlier effects, performed best for high variation SPEI-1 and SPEI-3, while the W-BS-SVR model was better for SPEI-6.","[Fung, Kit Fai; Huang, Yuk Feng; Koo, Chai Hoon] UTAR, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Sungai Long Campus,Jalan Sg Long, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia","Huang, YF (corresponding author), UTAR, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Sungai Long Campus,Jalan Sg Long, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia.",huangyf@utar.edu.my,"Koo, Chai Hoon/L-2240-2017; Huang, Yuk Feng/J-5265-2016","Koo, Chai Hoon/0000-0001-7287-3394; Huang, Yuk Feng/0000-0001-6565-947X",Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Research Fund (UTARRF),The authors would like to thank Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Research Fund (UTARRF) for funding this research.,,92,4,4,2,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

Emerging techniques include the use of artificial intelligence (AI). One AI tool that has sparked interest in e-commerce is the automated negotiation agent (negotiation-agent). This study examines such agents, and proposes an offer strategy model of integrative negotiation for a negotiation-agent with a focus on negotiation agent-to-human interaction. More specifically, a new offer strategy was developed based on the integrative bargaining model, which emphasizes the importance of exchanging information among negotiators and multi-issue negotiation that includes package offers to achieve an integrative (win-win) outcome. This study incorporated an argumentation-based negotiation and the negotiation tactic of multiple equivalent simultaneous offers, which was programmed into the negotiation-agent. An experiment was conducted performing 49 negotiation-agent-to-human negotiations over three issues in online purchase tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Experimental results indicated that the proposed offer strategy with agent negotiation can enhance the persuasiveness of an offer and the performance of negotiation outcome (human counterpart's perception toward negotiation process, opponent-agent and desire for future negotiation). The findings confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed design and demonstrated an innovative approach to e-commerce transactions.","[Park, Jinsoo] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Rahman, Hamirahanim Abdul] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Ind Management, Gambang 26300, Pahang, Malaysia; [Suh, Jihae] Seoul Natl Univ, Big Data Inst, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Hussin, Hazami] Univ Teknol MARA Cawangan Melaka, Kampus Jasin, Merlimau 77300, Melaka, Malaysia","Suh, J (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Big Data Inst, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",jinsoo@snu.ac.kr; hamira.rahman@gmail.com; jihaesuh77@sun.ac.kr; hazami054@uitm.edu.my,,"Park, Jinsoo/0000-0003-2762-3446; Suh, Jihae/0000-0002-5586-9956; ., HAMIRAHANIM BINTI ABDUL RAHMAN/0000-0002-8073-7170",,,,79,0,0,2,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2019,11,23,,,,,,,6832,10.3390/su11236832,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KD9MV,WOS:000508186400304,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

To evaluate and document the success and reliability of the new DNN model, an ANN model based on five different data categories from the established database was developed and compared with the DNN model. Based on the results obtained of the coefficient of determination and root mean square error (RMSE), a significant increase in the performance prediction of the penetration rate is achieved by developing a DNN predictive model. The DNN model demonstrated better performance for penetration rate estimation compared with the ANN model and it can be introduced as a newly developed model in the field of TBM performance assessment.","[Koopialipoor, Mohammadreza; Tootoonchi, Hossein] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Tehran 15914, Iran; [Armaghani, Danial Jahed] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Mohamad, Edy Tonnizam] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Ctr Trop Geoengn GEOTROPIK, Sch Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Hedayat, Ahmadreza] Colorado Sch Mines, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA","Koopialipoor, M (corresponding author), Amirkabir Univ Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Tehran 15914, Iran.; Armaghani, DJ (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.",Mr.koopialipoor@aut.ac.ir; hossein.tootoonchi@yahoo.com; danialarmaghani@gmail.com; edy@utm.my; hedayat@mines.edu,"Hedayat, Ahmadreza/B-9282-2018; Koopialipoor, Mohammadreza/Q-7630-2019","Hedayat, Ahmadreza/0000-0002-7143-7272; ",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,The authors wish to express their appreciation to Universiti Teknologi Malaysia for supporting the present research.,,64,27,27,8,25,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-9529,1435-9537,,B ENG GEOL ENVIRON,Bull.

For this purpose, a soft computing approach is adopted. Two novel intelligence methods, including an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and a Genetic Programming (GP), are developed. In order to generate the required data for the intelligence methods, several push-out tests were conducted on various channel connectors at different temperatures. The dimension of the channel connectors, temperature, and slip are considered as the inputs of the models, and the strength of the connector is predicted as the output. Next, the performance of the ELM and GP is evaluated by developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Finally, the performance of the ELM, GP, and ANN is compared with each other. Results show that ELM is capable of achieving superior performance indices in comparison with GP and ANN in the case of load prediction. Also, it is found that ELM is not only a very fast algorithm but also a more reliable model.","[Shariati, Mahdi] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Mafipour, Mohammad Saeed; Bahadori, Alireza] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Mehrabi, Peyman] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Zandi, Yousef] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tabriz Branch, Tabriz, Iran; [Dehghani, Davoud] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Qeshm Int Branch, Qeshm, Iran; [Shariati, Ali; Nguyen Thoi Trung] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Inst Computat Sci, Div Computat Math & Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Shariati, Ali; Nguyen Thoi Trung] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Salih, Musab N.

The upper and lower walls of the cavity were adiabatic, while the right and left walls had warm and cold temperatures, respectively. This temperature difference causes a thermal flow from the right wall to the left wall. The elements of the coordination system in different directions, including velocity in the Y direction (V) and fluid temperature, were obtained using CFD. Adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used to train the CFD outputs and provided artificial flow field and temperature distribution along the cavity domain. The CFD outputs were used as input and output data for the ANFIS method. The position of the fluid layer in X and Y computing directions and fluid velocity (Y axis) were used as three inputs, and the fluid temperature was taken as the output in the ANFIS method training process. The data were categorized using fuzzy c-means clustering, and different numbers of clusters were taken as a key parameter in this method. Using the fuzzy inference system, it is possible to predict the nodes in the cavity not generated through CFD simulation so that different coordination of the fluid at these points can be computed. Using ANFIS method, it is possible to reduce the computation time of CFD method so that more nodes are predicted in a shorter period of time, while clustering method can enhance the computing time for each neural cell. The ANFIS method can also visualize the flow in the cavity and display the thermal distribution along with the heat source.

The thermal decomposition shows the presence of hemicellulose and some part of cellulose at 225-337 degrees C, the remaining cellulose and some part of lignin were degraded at 332-380 degrees C, and lignin was degraded completely at 480 degrees C. The predictive capability of artificial neural network model was studied using different architecture by varying the number of hidden neurone node, learning algorithm, hidden and output layer transfer functions. The residual mass, initial degradation temperature and thermal degradation rate at the end of the experiment increased with an increase in the heating rate. Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm performed better than scaled conjugate gradient learning algorithm. This result shows that rice husk degradation is best described using nonlinear model rather than linear model. For hidden and output layer transfer functions, 'log-sigmoid and tan-sigmoid', and 'tan-sigmoid and tan-sigmoid' transfer functions showed remarkable results based on the coefficient of determination and root mean square error values. The accuracy of the results increases with an increasing number of hidden neurone. This result validates the suitability of an artificial neural network model in predicting the devolatilisation behaviour of biomass.","[Alaba, Peter Adeniyi; Lee, Ching Shya; Patah, Muhamad Fazly Abdul; Daud, Wan Mohd Ashri Wan] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Popoola, Segun, I; Adetiba, Emmanuel; Akanle, Matthew Boladele; Atayero, Aderemi A.

The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, particularly in image classification and object detection, could be applied to overcome the current flaws of the vehicular occupant detection devices that often failed to serve as a triggering system to caretakers. In this paper, a technique for child detection with transfer learning is proposed. A real-time child detection system that consisted of a camera as an input medium, a classifier to detect the presence of a child and a triggering system in audio and visual forms was established. The modern convolutional object detector, SSD Mobilenet v1 was trained with Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset as a starting point of the training process. The model was then assessed and retrained to possess the ability to classify human into an adult or a child. The accuracy of the model was measured by counting the percentage of pixels labelled correctly per class. Based on the mean Average Precision (mAP), the detection system achieved an overall precision of 0.969 and the experimental results obtained showed a precision of 0.883, giving an error of less than ten percent.","[Chua, S.

It can be dangerous for humans, equipment, and buildings. To minimize its undesirable hazards, we proposed a state-of-the-art technology of fly-rock prediction based on artificial neural network (ANN) models and their robust combination, called EANNs model (ensemble of ANN models); 210 fly-rock events were recorded to develop and test the ANN and EANNs models. Of thi sample, 80% of the whole dataset was assigned to develop the models, the remaining 20% was assigned to confirm the models developed. Accordingly, five ANN models were designed and developed using the training dataset (i.e., 80% of the whole original data) first; then, their predictions on the training dataset were ensembled to generate a new training dataset. Subsequently, another ANN model was developed based on the new set of training data (i.e., EANNs model). Its performance was evaluated through a variety of performance indices, such as MAE (mean absolute error), MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), RMSE (root-mean-square error), R-2 (correlation coefficient), and VAF (variance accounted for). A promising result was found for the proposed EANNs model in predicting blast-induced fly-rock with a MAE = 2.777, MAPE = 0.017, RMSE = 4.346, R-2 = 0.986, and VAF = 98.446%. To confirm the performance of the proposed EANNs model, another ANN model with the same structure was developed and tested on the training and testing datasets. The findings also indicated that the proposed EANNs model yielded better performance than those of the ANN model with the same structure.","[Hoang Nguyen] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Xuan-Nam Bui] Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Min Fac, Dept Surface Min, Duc Thang Ward, 18 Vien St, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Xuan-Nam Bui] Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Ctr Min Electromech Res, Duc Thang Ward, 18 Vien St, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Trung Nguyen-Thoi] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Inst Computat Sci, Div Computat Math & Engn, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Trung Nguyen-Thoi] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Ragam, Prashanth] NIT, Dept Min Engn, Rourkela 769008, India; [Moayedi, Hossein] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Ctr Trop Geoengn Geotrop, Sch Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia","Trung, NT (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Inst Computat Sci, Div Computat Math & Engn, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam.; Trung, NT (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam.",nguyenhoang23@duytan.edu.vn; buixuannam@humg.edu.vn; nguyenthoitrung@tdtu.edu.vn; prashanth.rajam429@gmail.com; hossein.moayedi@gmail.com,"Trung, Nguyen Thoi/E-5467-2019; Ragam, Prashanth/J-7942-2019","Trung, Nguyen Thoi/0000-0001-7985-6706; Ragam, Prashanth/0000-0001-7574-976X; Bui, Xuan-Nam/0000-0001-5953-4902; Nguyen, Hoang/0000-0001-6122-8314",,,,63,13,13,0,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

The traditional modelling methodologies are dependent on datasets that involve large amount of unknown or unspecified input data and generally consist of time-consuming processes. The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) leads to a flexible mathematical structure that has the capability to identify non-linear and complex relationships between input and output data. There has been a major degradation of the Johor River Basin because of several developmental and human activities. Therefore, setting up of a water quality prediction model for better water resource management is of critical importance and will serve as a powerful tool. The different modelling approaches that have been implemented include: Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBF-ANN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP-ANN). However, data obtained from monitoring stations and experiments are possibly polluted by noise signals as a result of random and systematic errors. Due to the presence of noise in the data, it is relatively difficult to make an accurate prediction. Hence, a Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (WDT-ANFIS) based augmented wavelet de-noising technique has been recommended that depends on historical data of the water quality parameter. In the domain of interests, the water quality parameters primarily include ammoniacal nitrogen (AN), suspended solid (SS) and pH. In order to evaluate the impacts on the model, three evaluation techniques or assessment processes have been used. The first assessment process is dependent on the partitioning of the neural network connection weights that ascertains the significance of every input parameter in the network. On the other hand, the second and third assessment processes ascertain the most effectual input that has the potential to construct the models using a single and a combination of parameters, respectively. During these processes, two scenarios were introduced: Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. Scenario 1 constructs a prediction model for water quality parameters at every station, while Scenario 2 develops a prediction model on the basis of the value of the same parameter at the previous station (upstream). Both the scenarios are based on the value of the twelve input parameters. The field data from 2009 to 2010 was used to validate WDT-ANFIS. The WDT-ANFIS model exhibited a significant improvement in predicting accuracy for all the water quality parameters and outperformed all the recommended models. Also, the performance of Scenario 2 was observed to be more adequate than Scenario 1, with substantial improvement in the range of 0.5% to 5% for all the water quality parameters at all stations. On validating the recommended model, it was found that the model satisfactorily predicted all the water quality parameters (R-2 values equal or bigger than 0.9).","[Ahmed, Ali Najah] Univ Tenaga Nas, IEI, Selangor 43000, Malaysia; [Othman, Faridah Binti; Afan, Haitham Abdulmohsin; Ibrahim, Rusul Khaleel; Elshafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Fai, Chow Ming] Univ Tenaga Nas, ISE, Selangor 43000, Malaysia; [Hossain, Md Shabbir] Heriot Watt Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Putrajaya 62200, Malaysia; [Ehteram, Mohammad] Semnan Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Water Engn & Hydraul Struct, Semnan 3513119111, Iran","Ibrahim, RK (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",ruaw119.j@gmail.com,"El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014; Othman, Faridah/N-2491-2019; Chow, M.

The information captured by camera, such as road edges, traffic lights, and zebra lines, is highlighted using computer vision. The semantics of highlighted information is recognized by artificial intelligence. Sensors provide information on the direction and distance of obstacles, as well as their speed and moving direction. The communication technology is applied to share the information among the vehicles. Since vehicles have high probability to encounter accidents in congested locations, the proposed system enables vehicles to perform self-positioning with other vehicles in a certain range to reinforce their safety and stability. The empirical evaluation shows the viability and efficacy of the proposed system in such situations. Moreover, the collision time is decreased considerably compared with that when using traditional systems.","[Zhou, Zishuo; Siddique, Kamran] Xiamen Univ Malaysia, Jalan Sunsuria, Sepang 43900, Selangor, Malaysia; [Akhtar, Zahid] Univ Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Man, Ka Lok] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, AI Univ Res Ctr AI URC, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Man, Ka Lok] Swinburne Univ Technol, Sarawak, Malaysia","Siddique, K (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ Malaysia, Jalan Sunsuria, Sepang 43900, Selangor, Malaysia.",kamran.siddique@xmu.edu.my,"Siddique, Kamran/AAI-9472-2020","Siddique, Kamran/0000-0003-2286-1728","Office of Research and Innovation, Xiamen University Malaysia under XMUM Research Program Cycle 3 [XMUMRF/2019-C3/IECE/0006]; AI University Research Centre (AI-URC), Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China through the XJTLU Key Programme Special Fund [KSF-P-02]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Office of Research and Innovation, Xiamen University Malaysia under XMUM Research Program Cycle 3 (Grant No: XMUMRF/2019-C3/IECE/0006).

Artificial neural networks have proven to be excellent tools for prediction. In this work, the echo state network (ESN), which is a new concept of recurrent neural network (RNN), is used to predict failures in turbofan engines. The ESN was developed to solve the complexities of earlier RNNs. However, choosing the right topology and parameters for the ESN is often a difficult problem.

Nevertheless, very less attention has been given in unveiling the determinants of social media addiction. In this study, artificial intelligence and expert systems were applied through a hybrid SEM-artificial neural network approach to predict social media addiction. An integrated model of the Big Five Model and Uses and Gratification Theory was validated based on a sample of 615 Facebook users. Unlike existing social media studies that used SEM, in this study, we engaged a hybrid SEM-ANN approach with IPMA as the additional analysis. The new SEM-IPMA-ANN analysis is a novel methodological contribution where useful conclusion can be drawn based on not only the construct's importance but also its performance in prioritizing managerial actions. Primary focus will be given in improving the performance of constructs that exhibit huge importance with relatively low performance. Based on the normalized importance of the ANN analysis using multilayer perceptrons with feed-forward-back propagation algorithm, we found nonlinear relationships between neuroticism and social media addiction. This is a significant finding as previously only linear relationships were found. In addition, entertainment is the strongest predictor followed by agreeableness, neuroticism, hours spent and gender. The artificial neural network is able to predict social media addiction with an 86.67% accuracy. The new methodology and findings from the study will give huge impacts to the extant literature of expert systems and artificial intelligence generally and social media addiction specifically. We discussed the methodological, theoretical and practical contributions of the study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the essential aspects that interests researchers is how to estimate the quality of transmitted voice over VoIP for several purposes such as design and technical issues. Two methodologies are used to evaluate the voice, which are subjective and objective methods. In this study, the authors propose a non-intrusive machine learning-based (NIML) objective method to estimate the quality of voice. In particular, they build a training set of parameters - from the network and the voice itself - along with the quality of voices as labels. The voice quality is estimated using the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) method as an intrusive algorithm. Then, the authors use a set of classifiers to build models for estimating the quality of the transmitted voice from the training set. The experimental results show that the classifier models have a valuable performance where Random Forest model has superior results compared to other models of precision 94.1%, recall 94.2%, and receiver operating characteristic area 99.2% as evaluation metrics.","[Alkhawaldeh, Rami S.] Univ Jordan, Dept Comp Informat Syst, Aqaba 77110, Jordan; [Khawaldeh, Saed; Pervaiz, Usama] Univ Burgundy, Erasmus Joint Master Program Med Imaging & Appl, Dijon, France; [Khawaldeh, Saed; Pervaiz, Usama] Univ Cassino, Erasmus Joint Master Program Med Imaging & Applic, Cassino, Italy; [Khawaldeh, Saed; Pervaiz, Usama] Univ Girona, Erasmus Joint Master Program Med Imaging & Applic, Girona, Spain; [Khawaldeh, Saed; Pervaiz, Usama] Aalto Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Automat, Sensor Informat & Med Technol Grp, Helsinki, Finland; [Alawida, Moatsum] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Alkhawaldeh, Hamzah] Princess Sumaya Univ Technol, King Hussein Sch Comp Sci, Amman 11941, Jordan","Alkhawaldeh, RS (corresponding author), Univ Jordan, Dept Comp Informat Syst, Aqaba 77110, Jordan.",r.alkhawaldeh@ju.edu.jo,"Alkhawaldeh, Rami S./AAL-9097-2020","Alkhawaldeh, Rami S./0000-0002-2413-7074",,,,36,1,1,0,2,INST ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY-IET,HERTFORD,"MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE SIX HILLS WAY STEVENAGE, HERTFORD SG1 2AY, ENGLAND",1751-8628,1751-8636,,IET COMMUN,IET Commun.,Oct-08,2019,13,16,,,,,2609,2616,,10.1049/iet-com.2018.5430,,,8,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Engineering,JD7JB,WOS:000490155900025,,,,,11/3/2021

Although the adaptive neuro fuzzy system (ANFIS) and multilayer feed-forward neural network (MFNN) have been widely used to simulate hydrological variables, improving the accuracy of the above models is an important issue for hydrologists. In this article, the ANFIS and MFNN models were improved by the bat algorithm (BA) and weed algorithm (WA). Thus, the current paper introduces improved ANFIS and MFNN models: ANFIS-BA, ANFIS-WA, MFNN-BA, and MFNN-WA. The models were validated by applying river discharge, rainfall, and monthly suspended sediment load (SSL) for the Atrek basin in Iran. In addition, seven input groups were used to predict monthly SSL. The best models were identified through root-mean-square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE), standard deviation ratio (RSR), percent bias (PBIAS) indices, and uncertainty analysis. For the ANFIS-BA model, RMSE and RSR varied from 1.5 to 2.5 ton/d and from 5% to 25%, respectively. In addition, a variation range of NSE was between very good and good performance (0.75 to 0.85 and 0.85 to 1). The uncertainty analysis showed that the ANFIS-BA had more reliable performance compared to other models. Thus, the ANFIS-BA model has high potential for predicting SSL.","[Ehteram, Mohammad] Semnan Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Water Engn & Hydraul Struct, Semnan 3513119111, Iran; [Ghotbi, Samira] Sharood Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Sharood 3616713455, Iran; [Kisi, Ozgur] Ilia State Univ, Fac Nat Sci & Engn, Civil Engn Sch, GE-0162 Tbilisi, Georgia; [Ahmed, Ali Najah; Hayder, Gasim; Fai, Chow Ming] Univ Tenaga Nas, IEI, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Fai, Chow Ming; Krishnan, Mathivanan] Univ Tenaga Nas, Coll Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Afan, Haitham Abdulmohsin; EL-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Ahmed, AN (corresponding author), Univ Tenaga Nas, IEI, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia.; EL-Shafie, A (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",mohammdehteram@semnan.ac.ir; sami_ghotbi@yahoo.com; ozgur.kisi@iliauni.edu.ge; mahfoodh@uniten.edu.my; Gasim@uniten.edu.my; Chowmf@uniten.edu.my; mathivanan.krishnan@yahoo.com; haitham.afan@gmail.com; elshafie@um.edu.my,"Hayder, Gasim/C-5042-2013; Afan, Haitham Abdulmohsin/G-6932-2018; Chow, M.

Thanks to technological advances, today's educators and learners have ubiquitous and on-demand access to information. Technology has made it possible for us to communicate and share information effortlessly from anywhere in the world. However, the availability of vast amounts of heterogeneous educational content will not be useful unless we search, retrieve and integrate it, creating interoperable educational environments. The current challenges to integrating educational content arise from its distribution over several repositories. This research proposes AIREH (architecture for intelligent retrieval of educational content from heterogeneous environments), for the retrieval of digital content through agent-based virtual organizations. This flexible architecture facilitates the search for and integration of heterogeneous content through an information retrieval model that involves both case-based reasoning and federated search. Moreover, AIREH is based on an adaptive organization model for distributed planning, thanks to which, it manages open systems flexibly, dynamically, and effectively. The conducted case study gives very promising results and demonstrates the advantages of using agent-based virtual organizations in the retrieval of labeled digital content.

In silico reaction knockout simulation is one of the techniques applied to analyse the effects of genetic perturbations on metabolite production. Many methods consider growth coupling as the objective function, whereby it searches for mutants that maximise the growth and production rate. However, the final goal is to increase the production rate. Furthermore, they produce one single solution, though in reality, cells do not focus on one objective and they need to consider various different competing objectives. In this work, a method, termed ndsDSAFBA (non-dominated sorting Differential Search Algorithm and Flux Balance Analysis), has been developed to find the reaction knockouts involved in maximising the production rate and growth rate of the mutant, by incorporating Pareto dominance concepts. The proposed ndsDSAFBA method was validated using three genome-scale metabolic models. We obtained a set of non-dominated solutions, with each solution representing a different mutant strain. The results obtained were compared with the single objective optimisation (SOO) and multi-objective optimisation (MOO) methods. The results demonstrate that ndsDSAFBA is better than the other methods in terms of production rate and growth rate.","[Daud, Kauthar Mohd; Zakaria, Zalmiyah; Shah, Zuraini Ali] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Comp, Artificial Intelligence & Bioinformat Res Grp, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Mohamad, Mohd Saberi; Deris, Safaai] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Inst Artificial Intelligence & Big Data, City Campus, Kota Baharu 16100, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Mohamad, Mohd Saberi; Deris, Safaai] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Bioengn & Technol, Jeli Campus,Lock Bag 100, Jeli 17600, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Hassan, Rohayanti] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Comp, Software Engn Res Grp, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Ibrahim, Zuwairie] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Elect & Elect Engn, Pekan, Pahang, Malaysia; [Napis, Suhaimi] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Sinnott, Richard O.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Comp & Informat Syst, Melbourne Sch Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Mohamad, MS (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Inst Artificial Intelligence & Big Data, City Campus, Kota Baharu 16100, Kelantan, Malaysia.",saberi@umk.edu.my,"Kauthar, Mohd Daud/Z-1275-2019; Hassan, Rohayanti/M-1203-2015; Daud, Kauthar Mohd/AAB-4883-2021","Kauthar, Mohd Daud/0000-0002-4460-9462; Hassan, Rohayanti/0000-0003-1062-1719; Ibrahim, Zuwairie/0000-0003-1641-3478","Fundamental Research Grant Scheme Malaysia's Research Star Award (FRGS-MRSA) from Ministry of Education Malaysia; Ministry of Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [RDU190113, R.J130000.7828.4F720]",This research was funded by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme Malaysia's Research Star Award (FRGS-MRSA) from Ministry of Education Malaysia.

This issue has been addressed in numerous works using various approaches, of which the most popular one is to consider intrusions as anomalies with respect to the normal traffic in the network and classify network packets as either normal or abnormal. Improving the accuracy and efficiency of this classification is still an open problem to be solved. The study carried out in this article is based on a new approach for intrusion detection that is mainly implemented using the Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) and Monarch Butterfly optimization (MBO). This approach is implemented for preparing an artificial neural system (ANN) in order to increase the precision degree of classification for malicious and non-malicious traffic in systems. The suggestion taken into consideration was to place side-by-side nine other metaheuristic algorithms that are used to evaluate the proposed approach alongside the related works. In the beginning the system is prepared in such a way that it selects the suitable biases and weights utilizing a hybrid (ABC) and (MBO). Subsequently the artificial neural network is retrained by using the information gained from the ideal weights and biases which are obtained from the hybrid algorithm (HAM) to get the intrusion detection approach able to identify new attacks. Three types of intrusion detection evaluation datasets namely KDD Cup 99, ISCX 2012, and UNSW-NB15 were used to compare and evaluate the proposed technique against the other algorithms. The experiment clearly demonstrated that the proposed technique provided significant enhancement compared to the other nine classification algorithms, and that it is more efficient with regards to network intrusion detection.","[Ghanem, Waheed A.

The measured shear rate will have a value lower than the actual shear rate. Therefore, it is important to have a study on such scenario as the concentrated suspensions have a wide industrial application. The current method for actual shear rate prediction is a challenging task and quite time-consuming as several experimental works are required. Therefore, the development of a mathematical model with an acceptable accuracy is required. Multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) is employed to develop the prediction model by applying shear stress, volumetric concentration, particle size, and temperature as the input parameters while the actual shear rate is kept as the output variable. MLP-NN model with 9 hidden neurons is the model that has achieved the best performance in term of statistical analyses. Besides, MLP-NN models for five different temperature ranges (i.e., 11-20 degrees C, 21-30 degrees C, 31-40 degrees C, 41-50 degrees C, and 51-60 degrees C) are also proposed to investigate the potential of the developed model to achieve a better accuracy and ease the user while dealing with the specified temperature range. It is found that the MLP-NN models with the best performance for each temperature range are the models with 8 hidden neurons, 10 hidden neurons, 8 hidden neurons, 9 hidden neurons, and 9 hidden neurons respectively. The novelty of this research study is the application of artificial intelligence method to mimic rheological actual shear rate under wall slip condition.","[Chin, Ren Jie; Lai, Sai Hin; Ibrahim, Shaliza; Jaafar, Wan Zurina Wan; Elshafie, Ahmed Hussein Kamel Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Lai, SH (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",laish@um.edu.my,"Ibrahim, Shaliza/A-5854-2010; Chin, Ren Jie/X-1847-2019; Jaafar, Wan Zurina Wan/C-1032-2010; El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014","Ibrahim, Shaliza/0000-0001-9413-957X; Chin, Ren Jie/0000-0001-5422-5123; El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505",FRGS - Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia [FP015-2014A],The authors would like to express the highest gratitude for financial support from FRGS Grant no.

The contribution of this work is to present an integrated landslide modelling framework, in which an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is combined with the two optimization algorithms of whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and grey wolf optimizer (GWO) at Anyuan County, China. It means that WOA and GWO are used as two meta-heuristic algorithms to improve the prediction performance of the ANFIS-based methods. In addition, the step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method is used to obtain the initial weight of each class of landslide influencing factors. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, 315 landslide events in history were selected for our experiments and were randomly divided into the training and verification sets. To perform landslide susceptibility mapping, fifteen geological, hydrological, geomorphological, land cover, and other factors are considered for the modelling construction. The landslide susceptibility maps by SWARA, SWARA-ANFIS, SWARA-ANFIS-PSO, SWARA-ANFIS-WOA, and SWARA-ANFIS-GWO models are assessed using the measures of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and root-mean-square error (RMSE). The experiments demonstrated that the obtained results of modelling process from the SWARA to the SAWRA-ANFIS-GWO model were more accurate and that the proposed methods have satisfactory prediction ability. Specifically, prediction accuracy by area under the curve (AUC) of SWARA, SWARA-ANFIS, SWARA-ANFIS-PSO, SWARA-ANFIS-GWO, and SWARA-ANFIS-WOA models were 0.831, 0.831, 0.850, 0.856, and 0.869, respectively. Due to adaptability and usability, the proposed prediction methods can be applied to other areas for landslide management and mitigation as well as prevention throughout the world.","[Chen, Wei] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geol & Environm, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wei] Shaanxi Inst Geoenvironm Monitoring, Key Lab Mine Geol Hazard Mech & Control, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wei] Minist Land & Resources, Key Lab Coal Resources Explorat & Comprehens Util, Xian 710021, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Hong, Haoyuan] Nanjing Normal Univ, Key Lab Virtual Geog Environm, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hong, Haoyuan] State Key Lab Cultivat Base Geog Environm Evolut, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hong, Haoyuan] Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Panahi, Mandi] Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources KIGAM, Geosci Platform Res Div, 124 Gwahak Ro Yuseong Gu, Daejeon 34132, South Korea; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Wang, Yi] China Univ Geosci, Inst Geophys & Geomat, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Shirzadi, Ataollah] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Pirasteh, Saied] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Fac Geosci & Environm Engn, Dept Surveying & Geoinformat, Xipu Campus, Chengdu 611756, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Alesheikh, Ali Asghar] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Dept GIS, Fac Geodesy & Geomat Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Khosravi, Khabat] Univ Guelph, Sch Engn, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Panahi, Somayeh; Rezaie, Fatemeh] Islamic Azad Univ, North Tehran Branch, Young Researchers & Elites Club, Tehran 19585466, Iran; [Li, Shaojun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Rock & Soil Mech, State Key Lab Geomech & Geotech Engn, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Jaafari, Abolfazl] AREEO, Res Inst Forests & Rangelands, Tehran 13185116, Iran; [Dieu Tien Bui] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Bin Ahmad, Baharin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia","Shahabi, H (corresponding author), Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran.; Bui, DT (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.",h.shahabi@uok.ac.ir; dieu.tienbui@gmail.com,"Jaafari, Abolfazl/AAG-5500-2019; Shirzadi, Ataollah/AAX-9800-2020; Hong, Haoyuan/C-8455-2014; Khosravi, Khabat/M-1073-2017; ????, Wei Chen/ABB-8669-2020; Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017; Jaafari, Abolfazl/D-7305-2019; Panahi, Mahdi/M-4175-2017","Hong, Haoyuan/0000-0001-6224-069X; Khosravi, Khabat/0000-0001-5773-4003; Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; Jaafari, Abolfazl/0000-0002-3441-6560; Panahi, Mahdi/0000-0001-7601-9208; Wang, Yi/0000-0002-1347-7030; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0001-9668-8687; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0003-1666-1180; Rezaie, Fatemeh/0000-0003-1771-6753; Alesheikh, Ali Asghar/0000-0001-9537-9401; Pirasteh, Saied/0000-0002-3177-037X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41807192, 61271408]; Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi - Key Laboratory of Mine Geological Hazard Mechanism and Control, Shaanxi Provincial Natural Resources Department [2019JLM-7, 2019JQ-094, KF2018-05]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) [Q.J130000.2527.17H84]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41807192, 61271408), Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi (Program No. 2019JLM-7, Program No. 2019JQ-094), project funded by Key Laboratory of Mine Geological Hazard Mechanism and Control, Shaanxi Provincial Natural Resources Department (Program No. KF2018-05), and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) based on Research University Grant (Q.J130000.2527.17H84).",,137,47,47,17,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

The input parameters consisted of CH4 partial pressure, CO2 partial pressure, and reaction temperature, while the target parameters included the rate of CO and H-2 production. A neural network architecture of 3 13 2, 3 15 2, and 3 15 2 representing the input layer, hidden neuron layer, and target (output) layer were employed for the Leven-Marquardt, Bayesian regularization, and scaled conjugate gradient training algorithms, respectively. The ANN training with each of the algorithms resulted in an accurate prediction of the rate of CO and H-2 production. The best prediction was, however, obtained using the Bayesian regularization algorithm with the lowest standard error of estimates (SEE).

In this paper, a GIS-based open source software entitled Seismic-Related Vulnerability Calculation Software (SEVUCAS), based on the Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method and geographic information system, has been developed to assess seismic vulnerability by considering four groups of criteria (i.e., geotechnical, structural, socio-economic, and physical distance to needed facilities and away from dangerous facilities). The software was developed in C# language using ArcGIS Engine functions, which provide enhanced visualization as well as user-friendly and automatic software for the seismic vulnerability assessment of buildings. Weighting of the criteria (indicators) and alternatives (sub-indicators) was done using SWARA. Also, two interpolation methods based on a radial basis function (RBF) and teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) were used to optimize the weights of the criteria and the classes of each alternative as well. After weighing the criteria and alternatives, the weighted overlay analysis was used to determine the final vulnerability map in the form of contours and statistical data. The difference between this software and similar ones is that people with a low level of knowledge in the area of earthquake crisis management can use it to determine and estimate the seismic vulnerabilities of their houses. This visualized operational forecasting software provides an applicable tool for both government and people to make quick and correct decisions to determine higher priority structures for seismic retrofitting implementation.","[Lee, Saro; Panahi, Mahdi] Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources KIGAM, Geosci Platform Res Div, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejeon 34132, South Korea; [Lee, Saro] Korea Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geophys Explorat, 217 Gajeong Ro, Daejeon 34113, South Korea; [Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza] Shiraz Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Engn, Coll Agr, Shiraz 7144165186, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Alizadeh, Mohsen; Bin Ahmad, Baharin] UTM, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Shirzadi, Ataollah] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Khosravi, Khabat] Univ Guelph, Sch Engn, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Melesse, Assefa M.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, AHC 5-390,11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Yekrangnia, Mohamad] Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran 16785136, Iran; [Rezaie, Fatemeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Young Researchers & Elites Club, North Tehran Branch, POB 19585-466, Tehran 19585466, Iran; [Moeini, Hamidreza] Org Dev Renovat & Equipping Sch IR Iran, Tehran 1933884883, Iran; [Binh Thai Pham] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam","Shahabi, H (corresponding author), Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran.; Pham, BT (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.",h.shahabi@uok.ac.ir; phamthaibinh2@duytan.edu.vn,"Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017; Khosravi, Khabat/M-1073-2017; Shirzadi, Ataollah/AAX-9800-2020; Lee, Saro/H-6003-2012; Yekrangnia, Mohammad/AAT-4493-2020; Melesse, Assefa/F-9931-2013; Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza/G-9926-2014; Panahi, Mahdi/M-4175-2017","Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; Khosravi, Khabat/0000-0001-5773-4003; Lee, Saro/0000-0003-0409-8263; Yekrangnia, Mohammad/0000-0002-3213-5343; Melesse, Assefa/0000-0003-4724-9367; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0003-1666-1180; Rezaie, Fatemeh/0000-0003-1771-6753; Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza/0000-0003-2328-2998; Panahi, Mahdi/0000-0001-7601-9208","Korea Institute of Geoscience, Mineral Resources (KIGAM); Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) [Q.J130000.2527.17H84]","This research was supported by the Basic Research Project of the Korea Institute of Geoscience, Mineral Resources (KIGAM) funded by the Minister of Science and ICT, and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) based on Research University Grant (Q.J130000.2527.17H84).",,113,19,19,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

A classifier of support vector machine (SVM) was employed as a base classifier, and four Meta/ensemble classifiers, including Adaboost (AB), bagging (BA), rotation forest (RF), and random subspace (RS), were used to construct new ensemble models. SVM has been used previously to spatially predict landslides, but not together with its ensembles. We selected 20 conditioning factors and randomly portioned 98 landslide locations into training (70%) and validating (30%) groups. Several statistical metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, kappa, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC), were used for model comparison and validation. Using the One-R Attribute Evaluation (ORAE) technique, we found that all 20 conditioning factors were significant in identifying landslide locations, but distance to road was found to be the most important. The RS (AUC = 0.837) and RF (AUC = 0.834) significantly improved the goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy of the SVM (AUC = 0.810), whereas the BA (AUC = 0.807) and AB (AUC = 0.779) did not.

Nevertheless, the application of k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) specifically the conventional feed forward Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model for forecasting and scouting of high-performance archers have not been fully utilized. The current investigation predicted high and low-performance archers from a set of selected fitness and motor skill parameters trained on two distinct machine learning algorithms viz. ANN and k-NN. Methods. - A sample of 50 youth archers with the average age and standard deviation of (17.0 +/- 0.56) recruited from varying youth archery schemes completed a one end archery score test. Standardize physical fitness and motor skill parameters measurements constituting of the hand grip, vertical jump, standing broad jump, static balance, upper muscle strength and the core muscle were carried out. The Hierarchical Agglomerative Cluster Analysis (HACA) with Mahalanobis' distance was employed to group the archers with regard to the performance parameters assessed. The t statistic and Cohen's d effect size analysis were carried out on the group defined by the HACA to view through the performance differences of the archers. The ANN (single hidden layer with ten neurons) and k-NN (fine Euclidean-based) models were trained based on the measured performance variables. The tenfold cross-validation technique was utilized in the study. Results. - The HACA grouped the archers into two distinct clusters namely; high-performance archers (HPA) and low-performance archers (LPA). It was observed from the t-statistic as well as the effect-size analysis that the performance of the HPA archers differed from the LPA in standing broad jump, hand grip, upper muscle strength as well as the archery shooting score P<0.05 with a large to moderate effect-size d= 0.8-0.6. It was established that the ANN model outperformed the k-NN in the present study. The ANN demonstrated reasonably excellent classification on the evaluated indicators with a classification accuracy of 92% and a stronger Matthews correlation coefficient, i.e. 0.816 amongst other performance metrics in comparison to the k-NN model in classifying the HPA and the LPA. Conclusion. - These findings are invaluable to coaches and sports officials, particularly in the identification of high-performance archers from a consolidation of the selected few evaluated fitness and motor skill performance parameters. As a consequence, this approach, in turn, would save resources, time and energy during a talent search program. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.","[Musa, R.

Recently, ensemble-based techniques have become popular in flood susceptibility modelling due to their greater strength and efficiency in the prediction of flood locations. Thus, the aim of this study was to employ machine learning-based Reduced-error pruning trees (REPTree) with Bagging (Bag-REPTree) and Random subspace (RS-REPTree) ensemble frameworks for spatial prediction of flood susceptibility using a geographic information system (GIS). First, a flood spatial database was constructed with 363 flood locations and thirteen flood influencing factors, namely altitude, slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, stream power index (SPI), sediment transport index (STI), topographic wetness index (TWI), distance to rivers, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil, land use, lithology, and rainfall. Subsequently, correlation attribute evaluation (CAE) was used as the factor selection method for optimization of input factors. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, standard error (SE), confidence interval (CI) at 95%, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to validate and compare the performance of the models. Results show that the RS-REPTree model has the highest prediction capability for flood susceptibility assessment, with the highest area under (the ROC) curve (AUC) value (0.949, 0.907), the smallest SE (0.011, 0.023), and the narrowest CI (95%) (0.928-0.970, 0.863-0.952) for the training and validation datasets. It was followed by the Bag-REPTree and REPTree models, respectively. The results also proved the superiority of the ensemble method over using these methods individually.","[Chen, Wei; Wang, Xiaojing] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geol & Environm, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wei] Minist Land & Resources, Key Lab Coal Resources Explorat & Comprehens Util, Xian 710021, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wei] Shaanxi Prov Key Lab Geol Support Coal Green Expl, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Hong, Haoyuan] Nanjing Normal Univ, Key Lab Virtual Geog Environm, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hong, Haoyuan] State Key Lab Cultivat Base Geog Environm Evolut, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hong, Haoyuan] Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Shaojun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Rock & Soil Mech, State Key Lab Geomech & Geotech Engn, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj, Iran; [Wang, Yi] China Univ Geosci, Inst Geophys & Geomat, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Bin Ahmad, Baharin] UTM, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia","Hong, HY; Li, SJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Key Lab Virtual Geog Environm, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",171301013@stu.njnu.edu.cn; sjli@whrsm.ac.cn,"????, Wei Chen/ABB-8669-2020; Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017; Hong, Haoyuan/C-8455-2014","Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; Hong, Haoyuan/0000-0001-6224-069X","International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [115242KYSB20170022]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41807192]; Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi [2019JQ-094]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018T111084, 2017M613168]; Shaanxi Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017BSHYDZZ07]; Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) [96004000]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) [Q.J130000.2527.17H84]","This study was supported by the International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. 115242KYSB20170022), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41807192), Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi (Program No. 2019JQ-094), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2018T111084, 2017M613168), Project funded by Shaanxi Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2017BSHYDZZ07), the Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) (Grant No. 96004000), and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) based on a Research University Grant (Q.J130000.2527.17H84).",,51,62,62,20,47,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

The aim of this study is the spatial prediction of landslide using hybrid machine learning models including bagging (BA), random subspace (RS) and rotation forest (RF) with alternating decision tree (ADTree) as base classifier in the northern part of the Pithoragarh district, Uttarakhand, Himalaya, India. To construct the database, ten conditioning factors and a total of 103 landslide locations with a ratio of 70/30 were used. The significant factors were determined by chi-square attribute evaluation (CSEA) technique. The validity of the hybrid models was assessed by true positive rate (TP Rate), false positive rate (FP Rate), recall (sensitivity), precision, F-measure and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). Results concluded that land cover was the most important factor while curvature had no effect on landslide occurrence in the study area and it was removed from the modelling process. Additionally, results indicated that although all ensemble models enhanced the power prediction of the ADTree classifier (AUC(training) = 0.859; AUC(validation) = 0.813); however, the RS ensemble model (AUC(training) = 0.883; AUC(validation) = 0.842) outperformed and outclassed the RF (AUC(training) = 0.871; AUC(validation) = 0.840), and the BA (AUC(training) = 0.865; AUC(validation) = 0.836) ensemble model. The obtained results would be helpful for recognizing the landslide prone areas in future to better manage and decrease the damage and negative impacts on the environment.","[Binh Thai Pham] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Shirzadi, Ataollah] Univ Kurdistan, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Fac Nat Resources, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan; Asl, Dawood Talebpour] Univ Kurdistan, Dept Geomorphol, Fac Nat Resources, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Omidvar, Ebrahim] Univ Kashan, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Fac Nat Resources & Earth Sci, Kashan 8731753153, Iran; [Singh, Sushant K.] Virtusa Corp, 10 Marshall St, Irvington, NJ 07111 USA; [Sahana, Mehebub] WWF India, IGCMC, New Delhi 110003, India; [Bin Ahmad, Baharin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Nguyen Kim Quoc] Nguyen Tat Thanh Univ, Dept Informat Technol, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Lee, Saro] Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources KIGAM, Geosci Platform Res Div, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejeon 34132, South Korea; [Lee, Saro] Korea Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geophys Explorat, 217 Gajeong Ro, Daejeon 34113, South Korea","Shahabi, H (corresponding author), Univ Kurdistan, Dept Geomorphol, Fac Nat Resources, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran.; Lee, S (corresponding author), Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources KIGAM, Geosci Platform Res Div, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejeon 34132, South Korea.; Lee, S (corresponding author), Korea Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geophys Explorat, 217 Gajeong Ro, Daejeon 34113, South Korea.",h.shahabi@uok.ac.ir; leesaro@kigam.re.kr,"Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017; Lee, Saro/H-6003-2012; Shirzadi, Ataollah/AAX-9800-2020; Singh, Sushant/G-5007-2015","Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; Lee, Saro/0000-0003-0409-8263; Sahana, Mehebub/0000-0002-3166-5916; Singh, Sushant/0000-0001-6065-6050; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0003-1666-1180","Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) [Q.J130000.2527.17H84]; Korea Institute of Geoscience, Mineral Resources (KIGAM)","This research was supported by the Basic Research Project of the Korea Institute of Geoscience, Mineral Resources (KIGAM) funded by the Minister of Science and ICT and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) based on Research University Grant (Q.J130000.2527.17H84).",,104,45,45,6,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2019,11,16,,,,,,,4386,10.3390/su11164386,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IV7UO,WOS:000484472500130,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

The sole type of reactor that can produce PE in the gas phase is the fluidized bed reactor (FBR), and effective modeling and control of FBRs are of great importance for design, scale-up and simulation studies. This paper discusses these issues and suggests a novel advanced control structure for these systems. RESULTS A unified process modeling and control approach is introduced for ethylene copolymerization in FBRs. The results show that our previously developed two-phase model is well confirmed using real industrial data and is exact enough to further develop different control strategies. It is also shown that, owing to high system nonlinearities, conventional controllers are not suitable for this system, so advanced controllers are needed. Melt flow index (MFI) and reactor temperature are chosen as vital variables, and intelligent controllers were able to sufficiently control them. Performance indicators show that advanced controllers have a superior performance in comparison with conventional controllers. CONCLUSION Based on control performance indicators, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) controller for MFI control and the hybrid ANFIS-proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller for temperature control perform better regarding disturbance rejection and setpoint tracking in comparison with conventional controllers.

The performances of the models were compared based on the maximum coefficient of determination (R-2) and minimum root means square error (RMSE). Based on the results the ANN model presents the most accurate measurement, with the R-2 value of 0.868 and 18% RMSE.

Hard computing methods are not suitable for determining the optimal emission in a methane emission data set. Instead, soft computing solutions should be considered in an effort to obtain better optimal solutions for industrial problems. This paper utilized the Guidelines provided in the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to calculate and project methane emissions front selected six livestock in Sarawak, Malaysia. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) model was developed to project future methane emission by using number of livestock as the input parameter. The total CH4 inventory from the enteric fermentation of cattle, buffaloes, goats, sheep, swine and deer in Sarawak decreased front 1.860 to 1.856 Gg when calculation was carried out using the Tier 1 method. This decrease was due to population growth and the emission factors employed. Three statistical measures, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were employed for evaluation.

Accordingly, the extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost) was developed to estimate HL first; then, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was applied to optimize the performance of the XGBoost model. The classical XGBoost model, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Gaussian process (GP), and classification and regression trees (CART) models were also investigated and developed to predict the HL of building systems, and compared with the proposed PSO-XGBoost model; 837 investigations of buildings were considered and analyzed with many influential factors, such as glazing area distribution (GAD), glazing area (GA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), and relative compactness (RC). Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), variance account for (VAF), mean absolute error (MAE), and determination coefficient (R-2), were used as the statistical criteria for evaluating the performance of the above models. The color intensity, as well as the ranking method, were also used to compare and evaluate the models. The results showed that the proposed PSO-XGBoost model was the most robust technique for estimating the HL of building systems. The remaining models (i.e., XGBoost, SVM, RF, GP, and CART) yielded more mediocre performance through RMSE, MAE, R-2, VAF, and MAPE metrics. Another finding of this study also indicated that OH, RA, WA, and SA were the most critical parameters for the accuracy of the proposed PSO-XGBoost model. They should be particularly interested in smart city planning as well as the optimization of smart cities.","[Le Thi Le] Thanh Hoa Univ Culture Sports & Tourism, Thanh Hoa 440000, Vietnam; [Hoang Nguyen] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Zhou, Jian] Cent South Univ, Sch Resources & Safety Engn, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Dou, Jie] Nagaoka Univ Technol, Civil & Environm Engn, 1603-1 Kami Tomioka, Nagaoka, Niigata 9402188, Japan; [Moayedi, Hossein] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Ctr Trop Geoengn Geotropik, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia","Le, LT (corresponding author), Thanh Hoa Univ Culture Sports & Tourism, Thanh Hoa 440000, Vietnam.; Nguyen, H (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.",lethiledhvhttdl@gmail.com; nguyenhoang23@duytan.edu.vn,"Zhou, Jian/AAK-2267-2020; Dou, Jie/K-2809-2013; Zhou, Jian/M-2461-2018; Moayedi, Hossein/B-7999-2011","Zhou, Jian/0000-0003-4769-4487; Dou, Jie/0000-0001-5930-199X; Zhou, Jian/0000-0003-4769-4487; Moayedi, Hossein/0000-0002-5625-1437; Nguyen, Hoang/0000-0001-6122-8314","Thanh Hoa University of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Thanh Hoa City, Vietnam","The authors would like to thank Thanh Hoa University of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Thanh Hoa City, Vietnam, for supporting this study.",,69,24,24,11,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of different sample sizes and raster resolutions in landslide susceptibility modeling and prediction accuracy of shallow landslides. In this regard, the Bijar region of the Kurdistan province (Iran) was selected as a case study. Accordingly, a total of 20 landslide conditioning factors were considered with six different raster resolutions (10 m, 15 m, 20 m, 30 m, 50 m, and 100 m) and four different sample sizes (60/40%, 70/30%, 80/20%, and 90/10%) were investigated. The merit of each conditioning factors was assessed using the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) technique, whereas Alternating decision tree (ADTree), which has been rarely explored for landslide modeling, was used for building models. Performance of the models was assessed using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, kappa and RMSE criteria. The results show that with increasing the number of training pixels in the modeling process, the accuracy is increased. Findings also indicate that for the sample sizes of 60/40% (AUROC = 0.800) and 70/30% (AUROC = 0.899), the highest prediction accuracy is derived with the raster resolution of 10 m. With the raster resolution of 20 m, the highest prediction accuracy for the sample size of 80/20% (AUROC = 0.871) and 90/10% (AUROC = 0.864). These outcomes provide a guideline for future research enabling researchers to select an optimal data resolution for landslide hazard modeling.","[Shirzadi, Ataollah; Solaimani, Karim; Roshan, Mahmood Habibnejad; Kavian, Ataollah] Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources Sari, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Watershed Sci Engn, Sari, Iran; [Chapi, Kamran] Univ Kurdistan, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Fac Nat Resources, Sanandaj, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj, Iran; [Keesstra, Saskia] Wageningen Univ, Soil Phys & Land Management Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 4, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bin Ahmad, Baharin] UTM, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Dieu Tien Bui] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Dieu Tien Bui] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Bui, DT (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",buitiendieu@tdtu.edu.vn,"Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017; keesstra, saskia/Z-5477-2019; Shirzadi, Ataollah/AAX-9800-2020; Solaimani, Karim/AAC-9690-2019; Tien Bui, Dieu/K-2125-2012","Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; Tien Bui, Dieu/0000-0001-5161-6479; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0003-1666-1180",Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) [Q.J130000.2527.17H84],"We would like to thank the Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University for supporting this manuscript.

Several models have been developed for evaporation prediction under different scenarios, with artificial intelligence (AI) methods being the most popular. However, the existing models rely on several climatic parameters as inputs to achieve an acceptable accuracy level, some of which have been unavailable in certain case studies. In addition, the existing AI-based models for evaporation prediction have paid less attention to the influence of the time increment rate on the prediction accuracy level. This study investigated the ability of the radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) and support vector regression (SVR) methods to develop an evaporation rate prediction model for a tropical area at the Layang Reservoir, Johor River, Malaysia. Two scenarios for input architecture were explored in order to examine the effectiveness of different input variable patterns on the model prediction accuracy. For the first scenario, the input architecture considered only the historical evaporation rate time series, while the mean temperature and evaporation rate were used as input variables for the second scenario. For both scenarios, three time-increment series (daily, weekly, and monthly) were considered.","[Allawi, Mohammed Falah] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Civil & Struct Engn Dept, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Othman, Faridah Binti; Afan, Haitham Abdulmohsin; El-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Ahmed, Ali Najah; Fai, Chow Ming] Univ Tenaga Nas, IEI, Dept Civil Engn, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Hossain, Md.

Some soft computing benchmark models (SCBM) including the ADTree, the Support Vector Machine by two kernel functions such as Polynomial and Radial Base Function (SVM-Polynomial and SVM-RBF), the Logistic Regression (LR), and the Naive Bayes Multinomial Updatable (NBMU) models were used for comparison of the designed model. Results indicated that 19 conditioning factors were effective among which distance to river, geomorphology, land use, hydrological group, lithology and slope angle were the most remarkable factors for gully modeling process. Additionally, results of modeling concluded the RF-ADTree ensemble model could significantly improve (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.906) the prediction accuracy of the ADTree model (AUC = 0.882).

Artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic are two most widely used models in pattern classification. To build an efficient and powerful model, researchers have introduced hybrid models that combine both fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks. Among the hybrid models, the fuzzy min-max (FMM) neural network has been proven to he a premier model for undertaking pattern classification problems. While FMM is useful in terms of its capability of online learning, it suffers from several limitations in the learning procedure. Therefore, over the past years, researchers have proposed numerous improvements to overcome the limitations of the original FMM model. This paper carries out a comprehensive survey of the developments conducted on the FMM model for pattern classification. In order to assist recent researchers in selecting the most suitable FMM variant and to provide proper guidance for future developments, this study divides the variants of FMM into two main hoard categories, namely FMM variants with and without contraction. This division facilitates understanding of the developments conducted by researchers on the original FMM neural network, as well as provides the scope to identify the limitations that still exist in the FMM models. This paper also summarizes the use of FMM and its variants in solving different benchmark and real-world problems. Finally, the possible future trends are highlighted.","[Al Sayaydeh, Osama Nayel] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Comp Syst & Software Engn, Kuantan 26300, Malaysia; [Mohammed, Mohammed Falah] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Sch Comp Syst & Software Engn, Kuantan 26300, Malaysia; [Lim, Chee Peng] Deakin Univ, IISRI, Geelong Waurn Ponds Campus, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia","Mohammed, MF (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Pahang, Sch Comp Syst & Software Engn, Kuantan 26300, Malaysia.",osamasayaydeh@hotmail.com; falah@ump.edu.my; chee.lim@deakin.edu.au,"Sayaydeh, Osama/AAC-8394-2019; Sayaydeh, Osama/AAB-6447-2020; Lim, CP/D-1999-2009","Sayaydeh, Osama/0000-0003-2257-901X; Lim, CP/0000-0003-4191-9083; Falah Mohammed, Mohammed/0000-0002-5155-7461",FRGS [RDU160104]; IBM Centre of Excellence [RDU160366]; RDU [RDU 180369],"This work was supported in part by FRGS under Grant RDU160104, in part by the IBM Centre of Excellence under Grant RDU160366, and in part by the RDU under Grant RDU 180369.",,103,3,3,0,11,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1063-6706,1941-0034,,IEEE T FUZZY SYST,IEEE Trans.

Currently, analyses of wall slip are normally carried out through experimental study using a rheometer. These traditional methods are generally time consuming, as several experiment sets are usually required. The aim of this research is to develop an alternative, more efficient approach, by formulating a mathematical model able to predict the wall slip velocity with an acceptable level of accuracy. Specifically, this study investigates a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN) as an advanced method to predict wall slip velocity. It develops and tests several MLP-NN architectures that accommodate a range of fixed input variables including shear stress, concentration, temperature and particle sizes, with estimated wall slip velocity as the output variable. Using this method, users can perform wall slip velocity analyses by simply plugging different patterns of the proposed input variables into the recommended architecture. Our tests show an MLP-NN model with one hidden layer consisting of nine hidden neurons to be the best architecture for such purposes, producing a strong overall performance with an R-2 value of 0.9994 and maximum error of 28%. This research study is innovative in its use of artificial intelligence to predict wall slip velocity in rheological applications.","[Chin, Ren Jie; Lai, Sai Hin; Ibrahim, Shaliza; Jaafar, Wan Zurina Wan; Elshafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Lai, SH (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",laish@um.edu.my,"Ibrahim, Shaliza/A-5854-2010; Chin, Ren Jie/X-1847-2019; El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014; Jaafar, Wan Zurina Wan/C-1032-2010","Ibrahim, Shaliza/0000-0001-9413-957X; Chin, Ren Jie/0000-0001-5422-5123; El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505; ",Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia [FP015-2014A],This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia [FP015-2014A].,,66,5,5,1,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0952-813X,1362-3079,,J EXP THEOR ARTIF IN,J.

Biomass is considered as a net zero CO2 energy source. Gasification of biomass for H-2 and syngas production is an attractive process. The main target of this research is to improve the production of hydrogen and syngas from palm kernel shell (PKS) steam gasification through defining the optimal operating parameters using a modern optimization algorithm To predict the gaseous outputs, two PKS models were built using fuzzy logic based on the experimental data sets. A radial movement optimizer (RMO) was applied to determine the system's optimal operating parameters. During the optimization process, the decision variables were represented by four different operating parameters. These parameters include; temperature, particle size, CaOlbiomass ratio and coal bottom ash (CBA) with their operating ranges of (650-750 degrees C), (0.5-1 mm), (0.5-2) and wt% (0.02-0.10), respectively. The individual and interactive effects of different combinations were investigated on the production of H2 and syngas yield. The optimized results were compared with experimental data and results obtained from Response Surface Methodology (RSM) reported in literature. The obtained optimal values of the operating parameters through RMO were found 722 degrees C, 0.92 mm, 1.72 and 0.06 wt% for the temperature, particle size, CaO/biomass ratio and coal bottom ash, respectively. The results showed that syngas production was significantly improved as iL reached 65.44 vol% which was better than that obtained in earlier studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The present research investigates new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for the prediction of SF values of retaining walls, as important and resistant structures for ground forces. These structures have complicated performances in dynamic conditions. Consequently, more than 8000 designs of these structures were dynamically evaluated. Two AI models, namely the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA)-artificial neural network (ANN), and the genetic algorithm (GA)-ANN were used for the forecasting of SF values. In order to design intelligent models, parameters i.e., the wall thickness, stone density, wall height, soil density, and internal soil friction angle were examined under different dynamic conditions and assigned as inputs to predict SF of retaining walls. Various models of these systems were constructed and compared with each other to obtain the best one. Results of models indicated that although both hybrid models are able to predict SF values with a high accuracy and they can be introduced as new models in the field, the retaining wall performance could be properly predicted in dynamic conditions using the ICA-ANN model. Under these conditions, a combination of engineering design and artificial intelligence techniques can be used to control and secure retaining walls in dynamic conditions.","[Chen, Hui] Xinjiang Univ, Sch Geol & Min Engn, Urumqi 830047, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Asteris, Panagiotis G.] Sch Pedag & Technol Educ, Computat Mech Lab, Athens 14121, Greece; [Armaghani, Danial Jahed] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Ctr Trop Geoengn GEOTROPIK, Sch Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Gordan, Behrouz] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Geotech & Transportat, Skudai 81310, Malaysia; [Pham, Binh Thai] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam","Armaghani, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Ctr Trop Geoengn GEOTROPIK, Sch Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",xjuchenhui@126.com; asteris@aspete.gr; danialarmaghani@gmail.com; bh.gordan@yahoo.com; phambinhgtvt@gmail.com,"Armaghani, Danial Jahed/U-3273-2019",,,,,52,66,66,2,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Experimental data were used to predict the erosion rate with respect to the input testing conditions, namely, impact velocity, impingement angle, erodent size, and stand-off distance. The size of the erosive element of randomly shaped sand particles (silicon dioxide) is set between 300 and 600 mu m. Other input process parameters, such as the impact velocity between 30 and 50 m/s, the impingement angle between 30 degrees and 90 degrees, and the stand-off distance between 15 and 25 mm, are selected. The consistency between the experimental and fuzzy logic model values, with a 94.45 % accuracy, signifies that the proposed fuzzy logic model is suitable for predicting the erosion rate of reinforced ebonite composite materials. The maximum erosion rate is obtained between a 50 degrees and 60 degrees impingement angle.

Approaches that integrate predictive model with optimization algorithm such as hybrid soft computing have resulted in the enhancement of the accuracy and preciseness of models during problem predictions. In this research, the implementation of hybrid evolutionary model based on integrated support vector regression (SVR) with firefly algorithm (FFA) was investigated for water quality indicator prediction. The monthly water quality indicator (WQI) that was used to test the hybrid model over a period of 10years belongs to the Euphrates River, Iraq. The use of the WQI as an application for this research was stimulated based on the fact that WQI is usually calculated using a manual formulation which takes much time, efforts and occasionally may be associated with errors that were not intended during the subindex calculations. The parameters considered during the formulation of the prediction model were water quality parameters as input and WQI as output. The SVR model was used to verify the accuracy of the inspected SVR-FFA model. Different statistical metrics such as best fit of goodness and absolute error measures were used to evaluate the model. The performance of the hybrid model in recognizing the dynamic and nonlinear pattern characteristics was high and remarkable compared to the pure model. The SVR-FFA model was also demonstrated to be a good and robust soft computing technique toward the prediction of WQI. The proposed model enhanced the absolute error measurements (e.g., root mean square error and mean absolute error) over the SVR-based model by 42 and 58%, respectively.","[Li, Jing] Lanzhou City Univ, Sch Business, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Lanzhou City Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Abdulmohsin, Husam Ali; Hasan, Samer Sami] Univ Baghdad, Coll Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Baghdad, Iraq; [Li Kaiming] Lanzhou City Univ, Geog & Planning Sch, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Al-Khateeb, Belal] Univ Anbar, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Ramadi, Iraq; [Ghareb, Mazen Ismaeel] Univ Human Dev, Coll Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Sulaymaniyah, Iraq; [Ghareb, Mazen Ismaeel] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Comp & Engn, Dept Informat, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England; [Mohammed, Muamer N.] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Comp Syst & Software Engn, Kuantan 26300, Pahang, Malaysia; [Mohammed, Muamer N.] Univ Malaysia Pahang, IBM Ctr Excellence, Kuantan 26300, Pahang, Malaysia","Li, KM (corresponding author), Lanzhou City Univ, Geog & Planning Sch, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.",jlleaf@lzcu.edu.cn,"Al-Khateeb, Belal/X-4410-2019; Al-Khateeb, Belal/A-9398-2013","Al-Khateeb, Belal/0000-0003-3066-0790; Ghareb, Mazen/0000-0002-3937-2835",National Natural Science foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41661014]; university scientific research project of Gansu [2016A-071]; Urban Development Institute scientific research project of Gansu [2013-GSCFY-RW30],"This work is supported by National Natural Science foundation of China (41661014), the university scientific research project of Gansu (2016A-071) and the Urban Development Institute scientific research project of Gansu (2013-GSCFY-RW30).

To improve the network scalability, the SUs are organized into clusters. This article proposes a novel artificial intelligence-based trust model approach that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve traditional budget-based cluster size adjustment schemes. The RL-based trust model enables the clusterhead to observe and learn about the behaviors of its SU member nodes, and revoke the membership of malicious SUs in order to ameliorate the effects of intelligent and collaborative attacks, while adjusting the cluster size dynamically according to the availability of white spaces. The malicious SUs launch attacks on clusterheads causing the cluster size to become inappropriately sized while learning to remain undetected. In any attack and defense scenario, both the attackers and the clusterhead adopt RL approaches. Simulation results have shown that the single-agent RL (SARL) attackers have caused the cluster size to reduce significantly; while the SARL clusterhead has slightly helped increase its cluster size, and this motivates a rule-based approach to efficiently counterattack. Multi-agent RL attacks have shown to be less effective in an operating environment that is dynamic.","[Ling, Mee Hong; Yaug, Kok-Lim Alvin] Sunway Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Bandar Sunway 47500, Malaysia; [Qadir, Junaid] Informat Technol Univ, Elect Engn Dept, Lahore 54700, Pakistan; [Ni, Qiang] Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commun, Lancaster LA1 4WA, England","Ling, MH (corresponding author), Sunway Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Bandar Sunway 47500, Malaysia.",mhling@sunway.edu.my; koklimy@sunway.edu.my; junaid.qadir@itu.edu.pk; q.ni@lancaster.ac.uk,"Qadir, Junaid/Q-6329-2019; Ni, Qiang/B-4990-2010; Yau, Kok Lim/B-1672-2012","Qadir, Junaid/0000-0001-9466-2475; Ni, Qiang/0000-0002-4593-1656; Ling, Mee Hong/0000-0002-8273-458X; Yau, Kok Lim/0000-0003-3110-2782","Malaysian Ministry of Education under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [FRGS/1/2014/ICT03/SYUC/02/2]; Sunway-Lancaster Grant Scheme [SGSSL-FST-CSNS-0114-05, PVM1024]",This work was supported by the Malaysian Ministry of Education under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme FRGS/1/2014/ICT03/SYUC/02/2 and Sunway-Lancaster Grant Scheme SGSSL-FST-CSNS-0114-05 and PVM1024.,,37,4,4,1,14,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2332-7731,,,IEEE T COGN COMMUN,IEEE Trans.

A significant part of this knowledge is contained in images with limited metadata available which makes it difficult to explore the visual knowledge in the biomedical literature. Thus, extraction of metadata from visual content is important. One important piece of metadata is the type of the image, which could be one of the various medical imaging modalities such as X-ray, computed tomography or magnetic resonance images and also of general graphs that are frequent in the literature. This study explores a late, score-based fusion of several deep convolutional neural networks with a traditional hand-crafted bag of visual words classifier to classify images from the biomedical literature into image types or modalities. It achieved a classification accuracy of 85.51% on the ImageCLEF 2013 modality classification task, which is better than the best visual methods in the challenge that the data were produced for, and similar compared to mixed methods that make use of both visual and textual information.

TOPMODEL is a semi-distributed rainfall runoff model widely used in numerous water resource applications. However, literature has indicated relative weakness in TOPMODEL performances in streamflow prediction. Thus, radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) has been employed to improve the accuracy of streamflow prediction and then compared with TOPMODEL and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) performances. Four years of daily hydrometeorological data sets (for the period between 2007 to 2010) were used for calibration and validation analysis. The results have shown an improvement from 0.749 and - 19.2 of the calibration period to 0.957 and 0.001, and from 0.774 and -19.84 of the validation period to 0.956 and - 3.611 of Nash-Sutcliffe model (NS) and Relative Volume Error (RVE), respectively. RBF-NN performance has been established to improve the daily streamflow prediction; however, the MLP-NN was better in contrast with the involved method in the study. It can be concluded that TOPMODEL performance showed a high ability to simulate the peaks compared with both AI methodologies.","[Suliman, Ali H.

The prediction of leachate amounts is elementary in sustainable waste management and leachate treatment processes, before discharging to surrounding environment. In developing countries, the accurate evaluation of leachate generation rates has often considered a challenge due to the lack of reliable data and high measurement costs. Leachate generation is related to several factors, including meteorological data, waste generation rates, and landfill design conditions. The high variations in these factors lead to complicating leachate modeling processes. This study aims at identifying the key elements contributing to leachate production and developing various AI-based models to predict leachate generation rates. These models included Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-Multi-linear perceptron (MLP) with single and double hidden layers, and support vector machine (SVM) regression time series algorithms. Various performance measures were applied to evaluate the developed model's accuracy. In this study, input optimization process showed that three inputs were acceptable for modeling the leachate generation rates, namely dumped waste quantity, rainfall level, and emanated gases. The initial performance analysis showed that ANN-MLP2 modelwhich applies two hidden layersachieved the best performance, then followed by ANN-MLP1 modelwhich applies one hidden layer and three inputswhile SVM model gave the lowest performance. Ranges and frequency of relative error (RE%) also demonstrate that ANN-MLP models outperformed SVM models. Furthermore, low and peak flow criterion (LFC and PFC) assessment of leachate inflow values in ANN-MLP model with two hidden layers made more accurate values than other models. Since minimizing data collection and processing efforts as well as minimizing modeling complexity are critical in the hydrological modeling process, the applied input optimization process and the developed models in this study were able to provide a good performance in the modeling of leachate generation efficiently.","[Abunama, Taher; Othman, Faridah; Ansari, Mozafar; El-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Othman, F (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",faridahothman@um.edu.my,"Othman, Faridah/N-2491-2019; Abunama, Taher/AAB-5225-2020; El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014","Othman, Faridah/0000-0002-4952-3676; Abunama, Taher/0000-0002-8588-898X; El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505; Ansari, Mozafar/0000-0003-1535-0372","University of Malaya Research Grant [FL001-13SUS, RP017C-15SUS]; Ministry of Higher Education Fundamental Research Grant [FP016-2014A]","This study was financially supported by the University of Malaya Research Grant (FL001-13SUS, RP017C-15SUS) and the Ministry of Higher Education Fundamental Research Grant (FP016-2014A).",,55,6,6,3,29,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

This neighbourhood search mechanism could not be directly applied to combinatorial discrete optimisation problems. In order to tackle combinatorial discrete optimisation problems, the employed and onlooker bees need to be equipped with problem-specific perturbative heuristics. However, a large variety of problem-specific heuristics are available, and it is not an easy task to select an appropriate heuristic for a specific problem. In this paper, a hyper-heuristic method, namely a Modified Choice Function (MCF), is applied such that it can regulate the selection of the neighbourhood search heuristics adopted by the employed and onlooker bees automatically. The Lin-Kemighan (LK) local search strategy is integrated to improve the performance of the proposed model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, 64 Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances available in TSPLIB are evaluated. On average, the proposed model solves the 64 instances to 0.055% from the known optimum within approximately 2.7 min. A performance comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms further indicates the effectiveness of the proposed model.","[Choong, Shin Siang; Wong, Li-Pei] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, George Town, Malaysia; [Lim, Chee Peng] Deakin Univ, Inst Intelligent Syst Res & Innovat, Geelong, Vic, Australia","Wong, LP (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, George Town, Malaysia.",css15_com047@student.usm.my; lpwong@usm.my; chee.lim@deakin.edu.au,"Wong, Li-Pei/A-7075-2011; Choong, Shin Siang/T-5489-2017","Wong, Li-Pei/0000-0002-7308-0035; Choong, Shin Siang/0000-0001-5116-3473","Research University Grant of Universiti Sains MalaysiaUniversiti Sains Malaysia [1001/PKOMP/814274]; Ministry of Higher Education of MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Research University Grant of Universiti Sains Malaysia (Grant No: 1001/PKOMP/814274) for this research.

Methods: This secondary research collected data from macroeconomic and AI-specific data sets. The sources of data from which insights were gained included digital technology sectors and corporations and their functions. The focus was on the need to assess the capability of AI on business operations The macroeconomic data was collected from data resources of international organizations' including the World Economic Forum, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). In addition, this study has considered 19 economic indicators to analyze the economic outcome of AI in selected economies of Asia-Pacific. Results: From the results, the period between 2014 and 2016 witnessed China leading with over 25,000 citable documents on the AI topic. Regarding institutions that were observed to publish over 500 times on the AI topic, the countries in the ascending order include China (600), Hong Kong (1,100), and Singapore (2,000). As such, this study established that Asia-Pacific economies such as Hong Kong and Singapore though have smaller populations, but the majority of their higher education institutions have made a significant contribution to AI research; with the small economies also having a relatively higher number of computer scientists among the top 1,000 individuals. Additionally, through empirically analyses, during 1998-2016 with annual observations, it is found that various economic outcomes of AI were presented in 8 economies of targeted region. Limitations: At first, the future outlook of AI is just discussed in conceptual meaning while empirical context still needs to be examined in upcoming studies. At second, covering the overall South Asian region provides better findings with more generalization which is missing in current research. At third, other dimensions of AI and economy like implication of AI impact index and its relationship with macroeconomic variables is also missing in current research which could be reconsidered in coming studies. Conclusion: It is evident that AI exhibits the potential to be the main driver of Asia-Pacific's economic growth. Relative to the net and gross effect of AI on labor markets and the gross domestic product (GDP) of the top Asia-Pacific economies demonstrate that by 2030, AI might yield a 16-percent increase in output, translating into an estimated amount of $13 trillion. Overall, it is concluded that Asia-Pacific, when compared to developed regions such as North America, is lagging but the availability of a large pool of user data implies that the region can move ahead-given better resource and talent allocation.

Manual collection of data and its analysis for livestock monitoring is costly in terms of high man power and time consumption. In order to overcome this deficit, object detection and clustering methods are investigated in this research as it is in line with Smart Farming 4.0. Faster RCNN is used to help ranchers to detect livestock while clustering methods help to detect the herds and outliers effectively and efficiently. In clustering methods, K-means clustering technique and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise or DBScan clustering technique are adopted. In K-means clustering, k is an important parameter which represents the number of clusters. By changing the number of clusters, the pattern of clusters is observed. Then, the best k value is selected. In DBScan clustering, epsilon is an important parameter which represents the circle radius from a particular data point. The higher the value of epsilon, the formation of clusters becomes easier as it is easy to accept data point in a larger circle radius to form cluster. By changing the epsilon, the pattern of cluster is observed and chosen. Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance are used to compare the effects of different distance metrics on the results of clusters. Cluster pattern is compared between K-means and DBScan techniques. Obtained results show that DBScan overwhelmed K-means in term of efficient clustering in detecting the herds and outliers of livestock.","[Ismail, Zool Hilmi] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Ctr Artificial Intelligence & Robot, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia; [Chun, Alan Kh'ng Kean; Razak, Mohd Ibrahim Shapiai] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Malaysia Japan Int Inst Technol, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia","Ismail, ZH (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Ctr Artificial Intelligence & Robot, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia.",zool@utm.my,"Ismail, Zool Hilmi/A-8481-2011","Ismail, Zool Hilmi/0000-0002-5918-636X","Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology [Q.J130000.2509.05H54]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia [R.K130000.7843.4J276, Q.K130000.2543.19H21]","This work was supported in part by the Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology under Grant Q.J130000.2509.05H54, and in part by the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under Grant R.K130000.7843.4J276 and Grant Q.K130000.2543.19H21.",,20,1,1,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,175062,175070,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2952912,,,9,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,KF6ZZ,WOS:000509390800008,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

Optimization of software testing is still a major challenge, as prioritization of test cases remains unsatisfactory in terms of Average Percentage of Faults Detected (APFD) and time execution performance. This is attributed to a large search space to find an optimal ordering of test cases. In this paper, we have proposed an approach to prioritize test cases optimally using Firefly Algorithm. To optimize the ordering of test cases, we applied Firefly Algorithm with fitness function defined using a similarity distance model. Experiments were carried on three benchmark programs with test suites extracted from Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository (SIR). Our Test Case Prioritization (TCP) technique using Firefly Algorithm with similarity distance model demonstrated better if not equal in terms of APFD and time execution performance compared to existing works. Overall APFD results indicate that Firefly Algorithm is a promising competitor in TCP applications.","[Khatibsyarbini, Muhammad; Isa, Mohd Adham; Jawawi, Dayang N.

The current strategies used to achieve covertness of communication employs encryption. Encryption techniques minimize eavesdropping on the conversation between the conversing parties by transforming the message into an unreadable form. However, it does not prevent or discourage eavesdroppers from stealing and attempting to decrypt the encrypted messages using a brute-force attack or by randomly guessing the key. The probability of the eavesdropper acquiring the key and recovering the message is high as he/she can distinguish a correct key from incorrect keys based on the output of the decryption. This is because a message has some structure-texts, pictures, and videos. Thus, an attempt at decrypting with a wrong key yields random gibberish that does not comply with the expected structure. Furthermore, the consistent increase in computational power implies that stolen encrypted data may gradually debilitate to a brute-force attack. Thus, causing the eavesdropper to learn the content of the message. To this end, the objective of this research is to reinforce the current encryption measures with a decoy-based deception model where the eavesdropper is discouraged from stealing encrypted message by confounding his resources and time. Our proposed model leverages its foundation from decoys, deception, and artificial intelligence. An instant messaging application was developed and integrated with the proposed model as a proof of concept. Further details regarding the design, analysis, and implementation of the proposed model are substantiated. The result shows that the proposed model reinforces state-of-the-art encryption schemes and will serve as an effective component for discouraging eavesdropping and curtailing brute-force attack on encrypted messages.","[Omolara, Abiodun Esther; Jantan, Aman; Abiodun, Oludare Isaac; Arshad, Humaira] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, SFRG Lab, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Abiodun, Oludare Isaac] Bingham Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Karu, Nigeria; [Dada, Kemi Victoria] Ahmadu Bello Univ, Dept Stat, Zaria, Nigeria; [Arshad, Humaira] Islamia Univ Bahawalpur, Dept Comp Sci, Bahawalpur, Pakistan; [Emmanuel, Etuh] Arthur Jarvis Univ, Dept Math, Calabar, Nigeria","Omolara, AE; Jantan, A (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, SFRG Lab, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",styleest2011@gmail.com; aman@usm.my,"Abiodun, Esther O/A-3514-2019; jantan, aman/AAM-1283-2020","Abiodun, Esther O/0000-0002-7801-2541; ","USM RUI, Penang, Malaysia [1001/PKCOMP/8014017]; Center for Cyber Safety and Education, United States Internal Revenue Segregated Fund of (ISC)2, Inc. through the (ISC)2 Women Cybersecurity Scholarship Award, Clearwater, FL, USA [EIN: 45-2405127]","This work was supported in part by the USM RUI, Penang, Malaysia, under Grant 1001/PKCOMP/8014017, and in part by the Center for Cyber Safety and Education, United States Internal Revenue Segregated Fund of (ISC)<SUP>2</SUP>, Inc.

Conventional models generally used for evaporation prediction have a number of drawbacks as they are based on several assumptions. A novel approach called the co-active neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) is proposed in this study for the modeling of evaporation from meteorological variables. CANFIS provides a center-weighted set rather than global weight sets for predictor-predictand relationship mapping and thus it can provide a higher prediction accuracy. In the present study, adjustments are made in the back-propagation algorithm of CANFIS for automatic updating of membership rules and further enhancement of its prediction accuracy. The predictive ability of the CANFIS model is validated with three well-established artificial intelligence (AI) models. Different statistical metrics are computed to investigate the prediction efficacy. The results reveal higher accuracy of the CANFIS model in predicting evaporation compared to the other AI models. CANFIS is found to be capable of modeling evaporation from mean temperature and relative humidity only, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.93, which is much higher than that of the other models. Furthermore, CANFIS improves the prediction accuracy by 9.2-55.4% compared to the other AI models.","[Salih, Sinan Q.] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Allawi, Mohammed Falah] Al Esraa Univ Coll, Dept Civil Engn, Baghdad, Iraq; [Yousif, Ali A.] Univ Duhok, Coll Engn, Water Resources Engn Dept, Duhok, Iraq; [Armanuos, Asaad M.] Tanta Univ, Fac Engn, Irrigat & Hydraul Engn Dept, Civil Engn Dept, Tanta, Egypt; [Saggi, Mandeep Kaur] Thapar Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Patiala, Punjab, India; [Ali, Mumtaz] Deakin Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Deakin SWU Joint Res Ctr Big Data, Geelong, Vic 3125, Australia; [Shahid, Shamsuddin] UTM, Sch Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Al-Ansari, Nadhir] Lulea Univ Technol, Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Chau, Kwok-Wing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",yaseen@tdtu.edu.vn,"Ali, Mumtaz/AAF-8685-2020; Kaur, Mandeep/AAS-7505-2020; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018; FKA, SHAMSUDDIN SHAHID/B-5185-2010; Allawi, Mohammed Falah/AAU-1578-2020; Salih, Sinan/F-6284-2019; Armanuos, Asaad M./W-3315-2019; Saggi, Mandeep/ABI-4341-2020","Ali, Mumtaz/0000-0002-6975-5159; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; FKA, SHAMSUDDIN SHAHID/0000-0001-9621-6452; Salih, Sinan/0000-0003-0717-7506; Armanuos, Asaad M./0000-0002-4134-0429; ",,,,56,17,17,0,1,"HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV, DEPT CIVIL & STRUCTURAL ENG",HONG KONG,"HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",1994-2060,1997-003X,,ENG APPL COMP FLUID,Eng.

These innovations enabled the clinicians to view the human body in high-resolution or three-dimensional cross-sectional slices, which resulted in an increase in the accuracy of the diagnosis and the examination of patients in a non-invasive manner. The fundamental step for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans classifiers is their ability to extract meaningful features. As a result, many works have proposed different methods for features extraction to classify the abnormal growths in the brain MRI scans. More recently, the application of deep learning algorithms to medical imaging leads to impressive performance enhancements in classifying and diagnosing complicated pathologies, such as brain tumors. In this paper, a deep learning feature extraction algorithm is proposed to extract the relevant features from MRI brain scans. In parallel, handcrafted features are extracted using the modified gray level co-occurrence matrix (MGLCM) method. Subsequently, the extracted relevant features are combined with handcrafted features to improve the classification process of MRI brain scans with support vector machine (SVM) used as the classifier. The obtained results proved that the combination of the deep learning approach and the handcrafted features extracted by MGLCM improves the accuracy of classification of the SVM classifier up to 99.30%.","[Hasan, Ali M.] Al Nahrain Univ, Coll Med, Baghdad 10072, Iraq; [Jalab, Hamid A.] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Meziane, Farid] Univ Salford, Sch Sci Engn & Environm, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England; [Kahtan, Hasan] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Comp Syst & Software Engn, Pahang 26600, Malaysia; [Al-Ahmad, Ahmad Salah] Amer Univ Middle East, Coll Business Adm, Al Ahmadi 54200, Kuwait","Jalab, HA (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",hamidjalab@um.edu.my,"Jalab, Hamid A./B-5285-2010; Hasan, Ali M./C-5262-2017; Meziane, Farid/ABE-9919-2020; Kahtan, Hasan/AAC-5991-2020","Jalab, Hamid A./0000-0002-4823-6851; Hasan, Ali M./0000-0001-9151-6958; Meziane, Farid/0000-0001-9811-6914; Kahtan, Hasan/0000-0001-6521-7081",research and innovation of university Malaysia Pahang under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) [RDU190189],This work was supported by the research and innovation of university Malaysia Pahang under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) No: RDU190189.,,29,6,6,0,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,79959,79967,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2922691,,,9,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,IH6KB,WOS:000474603300001,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

Their usage is beneficial in metabolic engineering as they help predict and improve desired products. However, one of the primary challenges in model building is parameter estimation. It is the process to find near-optimal values of kinetic parameters which may culminate in the best fit of model prediction to experimental data. Methods: This paper proposes an improved scatter search algorithm to address the challenging parameter estimation problem. The improved algorithm is based on hybridization of quasi opposition-based learning in enhanced scatter search (QOBLESS) method. The algorithm is tested using a large-scale metabolic model of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Results: The experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm performs better than other algorithms in terms of convergence speed and the minimum value of the objective function (log-likelihood). The estimated parameters from the experiment produce a better model by means of obtaining a reasonable good fit of model prediction to the experimental data. Conclusion: The kinetic parameters' value obtained from our work was able to result in a reasonable best fit of model prediction to the experimental data, which contributes to a better understanding and produced more accurate model. Based on the results, the QOBLESS method can be used as an efficient parameter estimation method in large-scale kinetic model building.","[Remli, Muhammad Akmal] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Comp Syst & Software Engn, Kuantan 26300, Pahang, Malaysia; [Mohamad, Mohd Saberi; Deris, Safaai] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Inst Artificial Intelligence & Big Data, City Campus, Kota Baharu 16100, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Mohamad, Mohd Saberi; Deris, Safaai] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Bioengn & Technol, Jeli Campus,Lock Bag 100, Jeli 17600, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Sinnott, Richard] Univ Melbourne, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Napis, Suhaimi] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia","Mohamad, MS (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Inst Artificial Intelligence & Big Data, City Campus, Kota Baharu 16100, Kelantan, Malaysia.",saberi@umk.edu.my,"Remli, Muhammad Akmal/K-9914-2017","Remli, Muhammad Akmal/0000-0002-7800-0057","Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education via Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [R.J130000.7828.4F886]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Malaysia via Flagship Grant [Q.J130000.2428.03G57]","Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education via Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (grant number: R.J130000.7828.4F886).

Four non-dimensional geometry parameters of scour hole shape are predicted by these models including the maximum scour depth (S), the distance of S from the weir (XS), the maximum height of downstream deposited sediments (hd), and distance of hd from the weir (XD). The best results over train data derived for XS/Z and hd/Z by the MLP model with R-2 are 0.95 and 0.96 respectively; the best predictions for S/Z and XD/Z are from the ANFIS model with R-2 0.91 and 0.96 respectively.

Three different bio-inspired optimization algorithms namely particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and differential evolution (DE) were individually used to tune the membership function of ANFIS model in order to improve the capability of stream flow forecasting. Different combination of antecedent stream flow was used to develop the forecasting models. The performance of the models was evaluated using a number of metrics including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and Willmott's Index (WI) statistics. The results revealed that increasing number of inputs has a positive impact on the forecasting ability of both ANFIS and hybrid ANFIS models.

Recently, there has been a rising trend of employing unsupervised machine learning using unstructured raw network data to improve network performance and provide services, such as traffic engineering, anomaly detection, Internet traffic classification, and quality of service optimization. The growing interest in applying unsupervised learning techniques in networking stems from their great success in other fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and optimal control (e.g., for developing autonomous self-driving cars). In addition, unsupervised learning can unconstrain us from the need for labeled data and manual handcrafted feature engineering, thereby facilitating flexible, general, and automated methods of machine learning. The focus of this survey paper is to provide an overview of applications of unsupervised learning in the domain of networking. We provide a comprehensive survey highlighting recent advancements in unsupervised learning techniques, and describe their applications in various learning tasks, in the context of networking. We also provide a discussion on future directions and open research issues, while identifying potential pitfalls. While a few survey papers focusing on applications of machine learning in networking have previously been published, a survey of similar scope and breadth is missing in the literature.

Such numerical combination can develop a smart multiphase bubble column reactor with the ability of low-cost computational time when considering the big data. However, the accuracy of such models should be improved by optimizing the data parameters. This paper uses an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to train four big data inputs with a novel integration of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of gas. The results show that the increasing number of input variables improves the intelligence of the ANFIS method up to , and the number of rules during the learning process has a significant effect on the accuracy of this type of modeling. Furthermore, the proper selection of model's parameters results in higher accuracy in the prediction of the flow characteristics in the column structure.","[Mosavi, Amir] Obuda Univ, Kando Kalman Fac Elect Engn, Inst Automat, Budapest, Hungary; [Mosavi, Amir; Tah, Joseph H.

The analysis of brain tumors without human intervention is considered a significant area of research because the extracted brain images need to be optimized using a segmentation algorithm that is highly resilient to noise and cluster size sensitivity problems and automatically detects the region of interest (ROI). In this paper, an improved orthogonal gamma distribution-based machine-learning approach is used to analyze the under- segments and over-segments of brain tumor regions to automatically detect abnormalities in the ROI. Further data imbalances due to improper edge matching in the abnormal region is sampled by matching the edge coordinates and sensitivity, and the selectivity parameters are measured using the machine learning algorithm. The benchmark medical image database was collected and analyzed to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the optimal automatic detection in tumor and non-tumor regions. The mean error rate of the algorithm was determined using a mathematical formulation. The system is evaluated based on experimental results that showed the method of orthogonal gamma distribution with the machine learning approach attained an accuracy of 99.55% in detecting brain tumors. This research contributes to the field of brain abnormality detection and analysis without human intervention in the health care sector.","[Manogaran, Gunasekaran] Univ Calif Davis, John Muir Inst Environm, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Shakeel, P.

The purpose is to increase the spectrum utilization for enhanced network performance. Clustering segregates SUs in a CRN into logical groups (clusters) with each consisting of a leader (cluster head) and member nodes. A budget-based cluster size adjustment scheme is applied to enable each cluster to adjust its number of member nodes in its cluster based on the availability of white spaces in order to improve network scalability. However, cluster size adjustment is prone to attacks by malicious SUs that launch random and intelligent attacks. Hence, we incorporate an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning (RL) into a trust model to countermeasure the random and intelligent attacks. The simulation results show that RL-based trust model increases the utilization of white spaces and cluster size to improve network scalability and enhance network performance despite the presence of RL-based intelligent attacks.","[Manohar, Anita Latsmi; Yau, Kok-Lim Alvin; Ling, Mee Hong] Sunway Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Subang Jaya 47500, Malaysia; [Khan, Suleman] Sch Informat Technol, Monash Univ Malaysia Campus, Subang Jaya 47500, Malaysia","Yau, KLA (corresponding author), Sunway Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Subang Jaya 47500, Malaysia.",koklimy@sunway.edu.my,"Khan, Suleman/X-3827-2019; Yau, Kok Lim/B-1672-2012","Khan, Suleman/0000-0003-1190-258X; Khan, Suleman/0000-0002-5725-6184; Yau, Kok Lim/0000-0003-3110-2782",,,,51,3,3,0,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,117,130,,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885070,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,HG8YU,WOS:000455293700001,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Accepted",,,11/3/2021

In many applications, the environment of a robot changes with time in a manner that has not been foreseen by its designer. Additionally, information on the environment is commonly inaccurate and incomplete, which is attributed to the restricted sensory activity of sensors. A new online sensor-based motion planning algorithm, which employs a fuzzy multilayer decision controller, is proposed in this study to enhance the quality of the next position in terms of safety and optimality. Fuzzy logic controller (FLC) utilizes the prediction and priority rules of multilayer approach for an effective and intelligent proposed method. Moreover, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is designed, which constructs and optimizes an FLC using a given dataset of input/output variables. The ANFIS shortens the high runtime of fuzzy system, optimizes the parameters of the membership functions of inputs and outputs of the fuzzy-multilayer decision controller, and rearranges the rules to enhance the efficiency of the overall approach. The simulation and comparison results indicate the superiority of the proposed path planning algorithm from other well-known algorithms.","[Kamil, Farah] AL Furat AL Awast Tech Univ, AL Diwaniyah Tech Inst, Kufa, Iraq; [Hong, Tang Sai; Zulkifli, Norzima; Ahmad, Siti Azfanizam] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Mech & Mfg Engn, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Khaksar, Weria] Univ Oslo, Dept Informat, Robot & Intelligent Syst Grp ROBIN, Oslo, Norway","Kamil, F (corresponding author), AL Furat AL Awast Tech Univ, AL Diwaniyah Tech Inst, Kufa, Iraq.",farahsaleh1977@gmail.com; saihong@upm.edu.my; weriak@ifi.uio.no; norzima@upm.edu.my; s_azfanizam@upm.edu.my,"Kamil, Farah/Y-9006-2019","Kamil, Farah/0000-0002-2178-4751",,,,42,2,2,0,6,"INST CONTROL ROBOTICS & SYSTEMS, KOREAN INST ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS",BUCHEON,"BUCHEON TECHNO PARK 401-1506, 193 YAKDAE-DONG WONMI-GU, BUCHEON, GYEONGGI-DO 420-734, SOUTH KOREA",1598-6446,2005-4092,,INT J CONTROL AUTOM,Int.

Step-wise Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) was utilized for the evaluation of the relation between landslides and landslide-related factors providing ANFIS with the necessary weighting values. The developed methods were applied in Langao County, Shaanxi Province, China. Eighteen factors were selected based on the experience gained from studying landslide phenomena, the local geo-environmental conditions as well as the availability of data, namely; elevation, slope aspect, slope angle, profile curvature, plan curvature, sediment transport index, stream power index, topographic wetness index, land use, normalized difference vegetation index, rainfall, lithology, distance to faults, fault density, distance to roads, road density, distance to rivers and river density. A total of 288 landslides were identified after analyzing previous technical surveys, airborne imagery and conducting field surveys. Also, 288 non-landslide areas were identified with the usage of Google Earth imagery and the analysis of a digital elevation model. The two datasets were merged and later divided into two subsets, training and testing, based on a random selection scheme. The produced landslide susceptibility maps were evaluated by the receiving operating characteristic and the area under the success and predictive rate curves (AUC). The results showed that AUC based on the training and testing dataset was similar and equal to 0.89. However, the processing time during the training and implementation phase was considerable different. SWARA-ANFIS-PSO appeared six times faster in respect to the processing time achieved by SWARA-ANFIS-SFLA. The proposed novel approach, which combines expert knowledge, neuro-fuzzy inference systems and evolutionary algorithms, can be applied for land use planning and spatial modeling of landslide susceptibility.","[Chen, Wei] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geol & Environm, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Panahi, Mandi; Panahi, Somayeh] Islamic Azad Univ, North Tehran Branch, Young Researchers & Elites Club, Tehran, Iran; [Tsangaratos, Paraskevas; Ilia, Ioanna] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Min & Met Engn, Dept Geol Sci, Lab Engn Geol & Hydrogeol, Zografou Campus Heroon Polytechniou 9, Zografos 15780, Greece; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj, Iran; [Li, Shaojun] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Geomech & Geotech Engn, Inst Rock & Soil Mech, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Jaafari, Abolfazl] Islamic Azad Univ, Karaj Branch, Young Researchers & Elites Club, Karaj, Iran; [Bin Ahmad, Baharin] UTM, Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Dept Geoinformat, Skudai, Malaysia","Shahabi, H (corresponding author), Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj, Iran.",h.shahabi@uok.ac.ir,"Tsangaratos, Paris/AAS-5876-2020; Jaafari, Abolfazl/AAG-5500-2019; ????, Wei Chen/ABB-8669-2020; Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017; Tsangaratos, Paraskevas/D-4966-2019; Panahi, Mahdi/M-4175-2017; Jaafari, Abolfazl/D-7305-2019","Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; Tsangaratos, Paraskevas/0000-0002-7396-4754; Panahi, Mahdi/0000-0001-7601-9208; Jaafari, Abolfazl/0000-0002-3441-6560","Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [115242KYSB20170022]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41807192]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018T111084, 2017M613168]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) [Q.J130000.2527.17H84]; Shaanxi Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017BSHYDZZ07]","We express our thanks to Karl Stahr, Editor-in-Chief of the journal of CATENA and our two anonymous reviewers.

Consequently, several computational intelligence techniques (CITs) for the prediction of ROP have been explored in the literature. This study explores the predictive capabilities of four commonly used CITs in the pre- diction of ROP and experimentally compare their predictive performance. The CIT algorithm utilizes predictors which are easily accessible continuous drilling data that have physical but complex relationship with ROP based on hydro-mechanical specific energy ROP model. The four CITs compared are the artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine, support vector Regression and least-square support vector regression (LSSVR). Two experiments were carried out; the first experiment investigates the comparative performance of the CITs while the second investigates the effect of reduced number of predictors on the performance of the models. The results show that all the CITs perform within acceptable accuracy with testing root mean square error range (RMSE) of 18.27-28.84 and testing correlation coefficient (CC) range of 0.71-0.94. LS-SVR has the best predictive performance in terms of accuracy with RMSE of 18.27 and CC of 0.94 while ANN has the best testing execution time at 0.03 s. Also utilizing the specific energy concept in chosen drilling parameters to be included among the predictors shows improved performance with five drilling parameters showing an improvement of 3%-9% in RMSE for LS-SVR in the two well studied. The utilization of the specific energy concept in the selection of the predictors in this study has demonstrated that the easily accessible drilling parameters have immense value to provide acceptable performance in the development of ROP model with CITs.","[Ahmed, Omogbolahan S.; Samsuri, Ariffin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Chem & Energy Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Adeniran, Ahmed A.] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Syst Engn, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia","Ahmed, OS (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Chem & Energy Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",saomogbolahan2@live.utm.my,,,,,,37,19,19,1,54,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0920-4105,1873-4715,,J PETROL SCI ENG,J.

The MSOINN uses clustering technique to form the data map, identifies the most similar patterns to predict the photovoltaic output power and then detects power fluctuation events. A novel memory layer is incorporated to establish the time-series learning. By using real life environment data, the proposed M-SOINN based real-time prediction engine detects power fluctuation events with a high detection rate of 92.69% and it outperforms the conventional self-organizing map (SOM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), focused time delay neural network (FTDNN), and nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARK) networks. The system is simulated in the PSCAD environment and later experimentally. The proposed MSOINN is then integrated into a power management system to mitigate power fluctuation events of the photovoltaic grid-tied system. Results show that the proposed power management system reduces 79.62% of power fluctuation events with an energy loss of 2.16% and battery state-of-charge maintains within 30%-100%.

The study reveals that the African Buffalo Optimization and the Ant Colony Optimization are the best in solving the symmetric TSP, which is similar to intelligence gathering channel in the strategic management of big organizations, while the Randomized Insertion Algorithm holds the best promise in asymmetric TSP instances akin to strategic information exchange channels in strategic management.","[Odili, Julius Beneoluchi; Kahar, Mohd Nizam Mohmad; Noraziah, A.; Haq, Riaz Ui] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Comp Syst & Software Engn, Kuantan, Malaysia; [Noraziah, A.] Univ Malaysia Pahang, IBM Ctr Excellence, Kuantan, Malaysia; [Zarina, M.] Univ Sultan Zainal Abidin, Fac Informat & Comp, Gong Badak, Malaysia","Odili, JB (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Comp Syst & Software Engn, Kuantan, Malaysia.",odili_julest@yahoo.com,"Odili, Julius/D-4037-2015; Mohmad Kahar, Mohd Nizam/M-5102-2016","Odili, Julius/0000-0002-1195-397X; Mohmad Kahar, Mohd Nizam/0000-0003-0811-0856; mohamad, zarina/0000-0003-4390-0773","Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Kuantan [GRS 1403118]; Ministry of Higher Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [FRGS-2-2013-ICT07-UniSZA-0201]; FRGS [RDU140101]","This work was supported by Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Kuantan [grant number GRS 1403118]; Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia [project number FRGS-2-2013-ICT07-UniSZA-0201, FRGS [project number RDU140101].",,79,3,3,0,9,TSI PRESS,SAN ANTONIO,"18015 BULLIS HILL, SAN ANTONIO, TX 78258 USA",1079-8587,2326-005X,,INTELL AUTOM SOFT CO,Intell.

Hence, modeling suspended sediment loads (SSL) in rivers contributes to various water resource management and river engineering. An evaluation of stand-alone data mining models (i.e., reduced error pruning tree (REPT), M5P and instance-based learning (IBK)) and hybrid models, (i.e., bagging-M5P, random committee-REPT (RC-REPT) and random subspace-REPT (RS-REPT)) for predicting SSL resulting from glacial melting at an Andean catchment in Chile has been conducted in this study. The best input combinations are constructed based on Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of hourly SSL time series data with water discharge (Q), water temperature (T) and electrical conductivity (C) for different time lags. Seventy percent of the available data (one year of hourly data) is used to calibrate the models (dataset training) and the remaining 30% is used for model evaluation (dataset testing). The performances of the models are evaluated using several quantitative and graphical criteria, including coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percentage of bias (PBIAS), the ratio of RMSE to the standard deviation of observation (RSR), a Taylor diagram and a boxplot. All the models performed well in predicting SSL. However, the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed rank tests revealed that predicted SSL significantly differed for different models except between IBK (or M5P) and REPT. The hybrid models performed better than individual models. The bagging-M5P had the best predictive capability while the KEPT had the poorest.","[Khosravi, Khabat] Sari Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ, Dept Watershed Management Engn, Mazandaran, Iran; [Mao, Luca] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecosyst & Environm, Santiago, Chile; [Mao, Luca] Univ Lincoln, Sch Geog, Lincoln, England; [Kisi, Ozgur] Ilia State Univ, Fac Nat Sci & Engn, GE-0162 Tbilisi, Georgia; [Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Shahid, Shamsuddin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Skudai 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia","Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",yaseen@tdtu.edu.vn,"Mao, Luca/C-6866-2012; Kisi, Ozgur/AAD-8932-2019; Khosravi, Khabat/M-1073-2017; FKA, SHAMSUDDIN SHAHID/B-5185-2010; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018","Mao, Luca/0000-0001-8619-5221; Khosravi, Khabat/0000-0001-5773-4003; FKA, SHAMSUDDIN SHAHID/0000-0001-9621-6452; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; Kisi, Ozgur/0000-0001-7847-5872",projects Fondecyt Regular [1170657],This research was supported by projects Fondecyt Regular 1170657.,,75,44,44,4,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

One minute segments of ECG signals were segmented from MIT databases where these segments are ten minutes before sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) onset The collected raw ECG signals were subjected to filter to remove the noise and then normalized. A frequency-domain feature and time-domain features were extracted from the Q-T segment, Q-T interval, R-R interval and QRS interval. The features were normalized to improve the performance of the classifier. Artificial intelligence classifiers; namely, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used separately on SCD and normal ECG signals.

On the one hand, we introduce a cognitively inspired hybridization metaheuristic that combines the strengths of two existing metaheuristics: the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and the dragonfly algorithm (DA). The aim of this hybridization is to reduce the problems of slow convergence and trapping into local optima, by striking a good balance between global and local search components of the constituent algorithms. On the other hand, we use the proposed metaheuristic to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as an alternative to existing traditional- and metaheuristic-based learning algorithms; this is for the purpose of improving overall accuracy by optimizing the set of MLP weights and biases. The proposed hybrid ABC/DA (HAD) algorithm comprises three main components: the static and dynamic swarming behavior phase in DA and two global search phases in ABC. The first one performs global search (DA phase), the second one performs local search (onlooker phase), and the third component implements global search (modified scout bee phase). The resultant metaheuristic optimizer is employed to train an MLP to reach a set of weights and biases that can yield high performance compared to traditional learning algorithms or even other metaheuristic optimizers. The proposed algorithm was first evaluated using 33 benchmark functions to test its performance in numerical optimization problems. Later, using HAD for training MLPs was evaluated against six standard classification datasets. In both cases, the performance of HAD was compared with the performance of several new and old metaheuristic methods from swarm intelligence and evolutionary computing. Experimental results show that HAD algorithm is clearly superior to the standard ABC and DA algorithms, as well as to other well-known algorithms, in terms of achieving the best optimal value, convergence speed, avoiding local minima and accuracy of trained MLPs. The proposed algorithm is a promising metaheuristic technique for general numerical optimization and for training MLPs. Specific applications and use cases are yet to be explored fully but they are supported by the encouraging results in this study.","[Ghanem, Waheed A. H.

To extract the fault regime, the knowledge of current signature will not be enough; therefore, mathematical model, numerical analysis, as well as artificial intelligence (AI) are taken into account to extract the exact unbalanced voltage stator fault. Analytical expressions are derived for a stator conductor segment in order to find out the conductors that are responsible for the generation of magnetomotive force (MMF). A test rig is designed using three-phase induction motor, two-axis PASPORT sensor, PC, and PASCO interface to compute the effect of MMF at the stator side through a new series of harmonics which are helpful to tackle the scrupulous effect of an unbalanced voltage at the incipient stage. Further, an unsupervised NN has been introduced that endeavors the principal components of the new series of harmonics. The statistical parameters of a new series of harmonics are contemplated as input features for NN that not only diagnose unbalanced voltage but also identify the degree of unbalanced voltage through feed-forward multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained by backpropagation. The validation and performance of proposed methods have been theoretically and experimentally analyzed on a custom-designed test rig under various levels of unbalanced voltage. Moreover, the NN classification method shows higher accuracy with enough robustness to various levels of unbalanced voltage, which states that the proposed method is suitable for the real-world applications.","[Sheikh, Muhammad Aman; Nor, Nursyarizal Mohd; Ibrahim, Taib; Irfan, Muhammad] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Seri Iskandar 32610, Bandar, Malaysia","Sheikh, MA (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Seri Iskandar 32610, Bandar, Malaysia.",engr.aman136@gmail.com; nursyarizal_mnor@petronas.com.my; taibib@petronas.com.my; irfan16.uetian@gmail.com,"Irfan, Muhammad/AAB-6847-2019","Irfan, Muhammad/0000-0003-4161-6875",,,,28,0,0,0,17,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0941-0643,1433-3058,,NEURAL COMPUT APPL,Neural Comput.

Based on its feature, autonomous vehicle is expected to improve traffic flow, reduce accidents, reduce social exclusion and improve the utility of time on travel. It is increasingly accepted that the next step to the evolution of human transportation is the replacement of human as the driver by the Artificial-intelligence-capable machine. Regardless, the challenges remain especially in convincing the consumers to switch to autonomous cars despite the apparent benefits. In the past, papers highlighted individual trust toward machine as the key point to encourage acceptance of autonomous cars. This paper seeks to highlight the ethical implications of the autonomous technology and how it is related to the user acceptance of the technology. This paper reviewed recent studies on the ethical implications of the autonomous vehicle and the user acceptance of the technology. A systematic review of papers from the literature was done using Scopus, ISI and Web of Science. The results of the review have shown that the level of trust, which may vary on the sociodemographic profile of the users, has been studied as one of the factors for user acceptance. Many researchers also highlight ethical implication as an important aspect of autonomous technology that needs to be tended to. The researcher proposes that ethical implication can be an important element of user trust toward autonomous technology. Hence, there is a need to embed ethical implication as a construct for user trust leading to user acceptance model in future studies. In the line of this research review researcher was addressed the following comprehensive groups: examination of autonomous vehicle topographies and flexibility prototypes, consequences for street traffic and connectivity to substructure (specifically in the urban areas with the medium and low density), communal attitudes and apprehensions, transportable behaviour and plea, possible business models, and strategy implications. Lastly, the main objective of this research article is to recognise critical problems for the growth of an effort cluster investigation to comprehend attitudes of possible manipulators of AVs and to highpoint autonomous vehicle growth issues for Malaysian lawful agencies.","[Adnan, Nadia; Nordin, Shahrina Md] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Management & Humanities, Bandar Seri Iskandar, Perak, Malaysia; [bin Bahruddin, Mohamad Ariff] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Ali, Murad] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept HRM, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia","Adnan, N (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Management & Humanities, Bandar Seri Iskandar, Perak, Malaysia.",nadia.adnan233@gmail.com; shahrina_mnordin@utp.edu.my; ariffbahruddin@gmail.com; mali3@kau.edu.sa,"ali, murad/J-6826-2015; Ali, Murad/P-9188-2015; Adnan, Nadia/X-8320-2018","Adnan, Nadia/0000-0001-6356-5592",Yayasan Universiti Teknologi Petronas (YUTP) [0153AA-H31]; Management and Humanities department of Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP),"The researcher is eternally grateful to Yayasan Universiti Teknologi Petronas (YUTP) for awarding this research grant which is under the cost centre: 0153AA-H31, and Management and Humanities department of Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) for the support to conduct the study.",,77,26,27,12,72,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The modification can be made using in silico gene knockout simulation that is able to predict and analyse the disrupted genes which may enhance the metabolites production. Global optimization algorithms have been widely used for identifying gene knockout strategies. However, their productions were less than theoretical maximum and the algorithms are easily trapped into local optima. These algorithms also require a very large computation time to obtain acceptable results. This is due to the complexity of the metabolic models which are high dimensional and contain thousands of reactions. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm of Cuckoo Search and Minimization of Metabolic Adjustment is proposed to overcome the aforementioned problems. The hybrid algorithm searches for the near-optimal set of gene knockouts that leads to the overproduction of metabolites. Computational experiments on two sets of genome-scale metabolic models demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is better than the previous works in terms of growth rate, Biomass Product Couple Yield, and computation time.","[Arif, Muhammad Azharuddin; Daud, Kauthar Mohd] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Comp, Artificial Intelligence & Bioinformat Res Grp, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Mohamad, Mohd Saberi; Deris, Safaai] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Inst Artificial Intelligence & Big Data, City Campus, Kota Baharu 16100, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Mohamad, Mohd Saberi; Deris, Safaai] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Bioengn & Technol, Jeli Campus,Lock Bag 100, Jeli 17600, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Abd Latif, Muhammad Shafie] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Comp, Pervas Comp Res Grp, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Remli, Muhammad Akmal] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Comp Syst & Software Engn, Kuantan 26300, Pahang, Malaysia; [Ibrahim, Zuwairie] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Elect & Elect Engn, Pekan, Pahang, Malaysia; [Omatu, Sigeru] Osaka Inst Technol, Dept Elect Informat & Commun Engn, Osaka 5358585, Japan; [Manuel Corchado, Juan] Univ Salamanca, Biomed Res Inst Salamanca, BISITE Res Grp, Salamanca, Spain","Mohamad, MS (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Inst Artificial Intelligence & Big Data, City Campus, Kota Baharu 16100, Kelantan, Malaysia.",saberi@umk.edu.my,"Corchado, Juan M/D-3229-2013; Kauthar, Mohd Daud/Z-1275-2019; Remli, Muhammad Akmal/K-9914-2017; Daud, Kauthar Mohd/AAB-4883-2021; MOHAMAD, MOHD SABERI/J-3201-2014","Corchado, Juan M/0000-0002-2829-1829; Kauthar, Mohd Daud/0000-0002-4460-9462; Remli, Muhammad Akmal/0000-0002-7800-0057; Ibrahim, Zuwairie/0000-0003-1641-3478; MOHAMAD, MOHD SABERI/0000-0002-1079-4559","Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education via the Fundamental Research Grant Schemes [R.J130000.7828.4F886, R.J130000.7828.4F720]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia via the Fundamental Research Grant Schemes [R.J130000.7828.4F886, R.J130000.7828.4F720]",We would like to thank Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia for supporting this research via the Fundamental Research Grant Schemes (grant number: R.J130000.7828.4F886 and R.J130000.7828.4F720).,,43,4,4,0,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0010-4825,1879-0534,,COMPUT BIOL MED,Comput.

This study, as such, develops an optimal control strategy for the voltage and frequency regulation of Photovoltaic (PV) based MG systems operating in islanding mode using Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA). The intelligence of the GOA is utilized to optimize the PI controller parameters. This ensures an enhanced dynamic response and power quality of the studied MG system during Distributed Generators (DG) insertion and load change conditions. A droop control is also employed within the control architecture, alongside the voltage and current control loops, as a power-sharing controller. In order to validate the performance of the proposed control architecture, its effectiveness in regulating MG voltage, frequency, and power quality is compared with the precedent Artificial Intelligence (AI) based control architectures for the same control objectives. The effectiveness of the proposed GOA based parameter selection method is also validated by analyzing its performance with respect to the improved transient response and power quality of the studied MG system in comparison with that of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Whales Optimization Algorithm (WOA) based parameter selection methods. The simulation results establish that the GOA provides a faster and better solution than PSO and WOA which resulted in a minimum voltage and frequency overshoot with minimum output current and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD).","[Jumani, Touqeer Ahmed; Mustafa, Mohd Wazir; Rasid, Madihah Md; Leghari, Zohaib Hussain; Saeed, M.

In this research, a new hybrid approach of Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) and Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSOA) is used to optimize Karun-4 reservoir, increase energy production and minimize downstream water shortages. This Hybrid Algorithm (HA) brings about diversity of responses in PSOA, prevents entrapment of AFSA in local optimum traps and increases convergence speed and balances between the abilities to scan and make profit in the AFSA. This method was assessed based on reliability, vulnerability and resilience indices. In addition, based on a multi-criteria decision-making model, it was evaluated by comparing it with other evolutionary algorithms. To verify the HA, it was tested on few mathematical functions. Results indicated that the HA features performed higher reliability, lower vulnerability and resiliency, as compared with AFSA and PSOA. In addition, HA is ranked first according to the multi criteria decision making model. Further, among all the tested evolutionary methods, this new algorithm yielded the best answer for dam power plant's objective function.","[Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Karami, Hojat; Ehteram, Mohammad; Mousavi, Sayed Farhad; Farzin, Saeed] Semnan Univ, Dept Water Engn & Hydraul Struct, Fac Civil Engn, Semnan, Iran; [Mohd, Nuruol Syuhadaa; Hin, Lai Sai; El-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Civil Engn Dept, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Kisi, Ozgur] Ilia State Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Engn, Tbilisi, Georgia; [Kim, Sungwon] Dongyang Univ, Dept Railrd Construct & Safety Engn, Yeongju 36040, South Korea","Karami, H (corresponding author), Semnan Univ, Dept Water Engn & Hydraul Struct, Fac Civil Engn, Semnan, Iran.",yaseen@tdt.edu.vn; hkarami@semnan.ac.ir; mohammdehteram@semnan.ac.ir; n_syuhadaa@um.edu.my; fmousavi@semnan.ac.ir; laish@um.edu.my; ozgur.kisi@iliauni.edu.ge; saeed.farzin@semnan.ac.ir; swkim1968@dyu.ac.kr; elshafie@um.edu.my,"Lai, Sai Hin/H-3164-2018; Karami, Hojat/AAU-1618-2020; Kisi, Ozgur/AAD-8932-2019; Farzin, Saeed/AAB-3877-2020; MOHD, NURUOL SYUHADAA/B-9443-2010; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018; El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014","Lai, Sai Hin/0000-0002-7143-4805; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505; MOHD, NURUOL/0000-0002-1965-1087","University of Malaya Research Grant (UMRG), Malaysia [RP025A-18SUS]","The authors would like to appreciate so much the financial support received from the University of Malaya Research Grant (UMRG) coded RP025A-18SUS University of Malaya, Malaysia.",,32,9,9,0,10,KOREAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-KSCE,SEOUL,"3-16 JUNGDAE-RO 25-GIL, SONGPA-GU, SEOUL, 05661, SOUTH KOREA",1226-7988,1976-3808,,KSCE J CIV ENG,KSCE J.

Hierarchical feature-based semantic measures have been proposed to estimate the semantic similarity between two concepts/words depending on the features extracted from a semantic taxonomy (hierarchy) of a given lexical source. The central issue in these measures is the constant weighting assumption that all elements in the semantic representation of the concept possess the same relevance. In this paper, a new weighting-based semantic similarity measure is proposed to address the issues in hierarchical feature-based measures. Four mechanisms are introduced to weigh the degree of relevance of features in the semantic representation of a concept by using topological parameters (edge, depth, descendants, and density) in a semantic taxonomy. With the semantic taxonomy of WordNet, the proposed semantic measure is evaluated for word semantic similarity in four gold-standard datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed measure outperforms hierarchical feature-based semantic measures in all the datasets. Comparison results also imply that the proposed measure is more effective than information-content measures in measuring semantic similarity.","[Saif, Abdulgabbar; Ghareb, Abdullah Saeed] Univ Saba Reg, Dept Comp Informat Syst, Fac IT&CS, Marib, Yemen; [Zainodin, Ummi Zakiah; Omar, Nazlia] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Ctr Artificial Intelligence Technol, Bangi, Malaysia","Saif, A (corresponding author), Univ Saba Reg, Dept Comp Informat Syst, Fac IT&CS, Marib, Yemen.",agmssaif@gmail.com; ummizakiahzainodin@gmail.com; nazlia@ukm.edu.my; aghurieb@usr.ac,"Muttaleb, Ali/ABB-6070-2020; Omar, Nazlia/L-9901-2019; Saif, Abdulgabbar/R-7078-2016","Saif, Abdulgabbar/0000-0001-7476-1628; Omar, Nazlia/0000-0002-8173-8933","Ministry of Higher Education in MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [FRGS/1/2016/ICT02/UKM/02/11]; University of Saba Region",This work was partially funded by the Ministry of Higher Education in Malaysia under the grant no.

The evaluation of modeling process was checked by some statistical measures and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results show that, for combination of sample sizes of 60%/40% and 70%/30% with a raster resolution of 10 m, the RS model, while, for 80%/20% and 90%/10% with a raster resolution of 20 m, the MB model obtained a high goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy. The RS-ADTree and MB-ADTree ensemble models outperformed the ADTree model in two scenarios. Overall, MB-ADTree in sample size of 80%/20% with a resolution of 20 m (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.942) and sample size of 60%/40% with a resolution of 10 m (AUC = 0.845) had the highest and lowest prediction accuracy, respectively. The findings confirm that the newly proposed models are very promising alternative tools to assist planners and decision makers in the task of managing landslide prone areas.","[Shirzadi, Ataollah; Soliamani, Karim; Habibnejhad, Mahmood; Kavian, Ataollah; Khosravi, Khabat] Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources Sari, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Watershed Sci Engn, POB 48181-68984, Sari, Iran; [Chapi, Kamran] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Chen, Wei] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geol & Environm, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Binh Thai Pham] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Pradhan, Biswajeet] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & IT, CAMGIS, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Pradhan, Biswajeet] Sejong Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Resources Engn, 209 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05006, South Korea; [Ahmad, Anuar; Bin Ahmad, Baharin] UTM, Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Dept Geoinformat, Skudai 81310, Malaysia; [Dieu Tien Bui] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Dieu Tien Bui] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Bui, T (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.; Bui, T (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",a.shirzadi@uok.ac.ir; solaimani2001@yahoo.co.uk; roshanbah@yahoo.com; ataollah.kavian@yahoo.com; k.chapi@uok.ac.ir; h.shahabi@uok.ac.ir; chenwei0930@yahoo.com; khabat.khosravi@gmail.com; phambinhgtvt@gmail.com; Biswajeet.Pradhan@uts.edu.au; anuarahmad@utm.my; baharinahmad@utm.my; buitiendieu@tdt.edu.vn,"Khosravi, Khabat/M-1073-2017; Pradhan, Biswajeet/E-8226-2010; Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017; Solaimani, Karim/AAC-9690-2019; Shirzadi, Ataollah/AAX-9800-2020; ????, Wei Chen/ABB-8669-2020; Chapi, Kamran/L-9701-2018","Khosravi, Khabat/0000-0001-5773-4003; Pradhan, Biswajeet/0000-0001-9863-2054; Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0003-1666-1180; Chapi, Kamran/0000-0002-9466-665X; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0001-9668-8687; kavian, ataollah/0000-0003-1767-0708",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) [Q.J130000.2527.16H05],"We would like to thank the University of Agricultural Science and Natural Resources of Sari for supporting this manuscript.

This combination could result in ANFIS-ICA and ANFIS-FA models, which were applied to flood spatial modelling and its mapping in the Haraz watershed in Northern Province of Mazandaran, Iran. Ten influential factors including slope angle, elevation, stream power index (SPI), curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, rainfall, land use, stream density, and the distance to river were selected for flood modelling. The validity of the models was assessed using statistical error-indices (RMSE and MSE), statistical tests (Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests), and the area under the curve (AUC) of success. The prediction accuracy of the models was compared to some new state-of-theart sophisticated machine learning techniques that had previously been successfully tested in the study area. The results confirmed the goodness of fit and appropriate prediction accuracy of the two ensemble models. However, the ANFIS-ICA model (AUC = 0.947) had a better performance in comparison to the Bagging-LMT (AUC = 0.940), BLR (AUC = 0.936), LMT (AUC = 0.934), ANFIS-FA (AUC = 0.917), LR (AUC = 0.885) and RF (AUC = 0.806) models.

In this study, appropriate adjustments to the conventional coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) method are proposed to improve the mathematical procedure, thus enabling a better detection of the high nonlinearity patterns found in the reservoir inflow training data. This modification includes the updating of the back propagation algorithm, leading to a consequent update of the membership rules and the induction of the centre-weighted set rather than the global weighted set used in feature extraction. The modification also aids in constructing an integrated model that is able to not only detect the nonlinearity in the training data but also the wide range of features within the training data records used to simulate the forecasting model. To demonstrate the model's efficacy, the proposed CANFIS method has been applied to forecast monthly inflow data at Aswan High Dam (AHD), located in southern Egypt. Comparative analyses of the forecasting skill of the modified CANFIS and the conventional ANFIS model are carried out with statistical score indicators to assess the reliability of the developed method. The statistical metrics support the better performance of the developed CANFIS model, which significantly outperforms the ANFIS model to attain a low relative error value (23%), mean absolute error (1.4 BCM month(-1)), root mean square error (1.14 BCM month(-1)), and a relative large coefficient of determination (0.94).

A Geographic Information System (GIS) spatial database was generated from Lang Son city in Lang Son province (Vietnam). This GIS database includes a landslide inventory map and fourteen landslide conditioning factors. The suitability of these factors for landslide susceptibility modeling in the study area was verified by the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) technique. A landslide susceptibility prediction model based on RVM-ICA and the GIS database was established by training and prediction phases. The predictive capability of the new approach was evaluated by calculations of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC). In addition, to assess the applicability of the proposed model, two state-of-the-art soft computing techniques including the support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) were used as benchmark methods. The results of this study show that RVM-ICA with AUC = 0.92 achieved a high goodness-of-fit based on both the training and testing datasets. The predictive capability of RVM-ICA outperformed those of SVM with AUC = 0.91 and LR with AUC = 0.87. The experimental results confirm that the newly proposed model is a very promising alternative to assist planners and decision makers in the task of managing landslide prone areas.","[Dieu Tien Bui] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Dieu Tien Bui] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Shirzadi, Ataollah; Chapi, Kamran] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Nhat-Duc Hoang] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Fac Civil Engn, P809-K7-25 Quang Trung, Danang 550000, Vietnam; [Binh Thai Pham] Univ Transport Technol, Geotech Engn & Artificial Intelligence Res Grp GE, Hanoi 100803, Vietnam; [Quang-Thanh, Bui] VNU Univ Sci, Fac Geog, 334 Nguyen Trai, Hanoi 100803, Vietnam; [Chuyen-Trung Tran] Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Fac Informat Technol, Hanoi 100803, Vietnam; [Panahi, Mahdi] Islamic Azad Univ, North Tehran Branch, Young Researchers & Elites Club, POB 19585-466, Tehran, Iran; [Bin Ahamd, Baharin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Geoinformat, Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Saro, Lee] Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources KIGAM, Div Geol Res, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejeon 34132, South Korea; [Saro, Lee] Korea Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geophys Explorat, 217 Gajeong Ro, Daejeon 34113, South Korea","Shahabi, H (corresponding author), Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran.; Saro, L (corresponding author), Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources KIGAM, Div Geol Res, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejeon 34132, South Korea.; Saro, L (corresponding author), Korea Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geophys Explorat, 217 Gajeong Ro, Daejeon 34113, South Korea.",buitiendieu@tdt.edu.vn; h.shahabi@uok.ac.ir; a.shirzadi@uok.ac.ir; k.chapi@uok.ac.ir; hoangnhatduc@dtu.edu.vn; binhpt@utt.edu.vn; buitiendieu@tdt.edu.vn; trang.ch@gmail.com; panahi2012@yahoo.com; baharinahmad@utm.my; leesaro@kigam.re.kr,"Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017; Shirzadi, Ataollah/AAX-9800-2020; Hoang, Nhat Duc/AAD-8621-2019; Lee, Saro/H-6003-2012; Chapi, Kamran/L-9701-2018; Panahi, Mahdi/M-4175-2017; Tien Bui, Dieu/K-2125-2012","Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; Lee, Saro/0000-0003-0409-8263; Bui, Quang-Thanh/0000-0002-5059-9731; THAI PHAM, BINH/0000-0001-9707-840X; Chapi, Kamran/0000-0002-9466-665X; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0003-1666-1180; Panahi, Mahdi/0000-0001-7601-9208; Tien Bui, Dieu/0000-0001-5161-6479; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0001-9668-8687","Basic Research Project of the Korea Institute of Geoscience, Mineral Resources (KIGAM) - Minister of Science and ICT; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) based on Research University Grant [Q.J130000.2527.17H84]","This research was supported by the Basic Research Project of the Korea Institute of Geoscience, Mineral Resources (KIGAM) funded by the Minister of Science and ICT and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) based on Research University Grant (Q.J130000.2527.17H84).",,128,56,56,2,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,OCT,2018,10,10,,,,,,,1538,10.3390/rs10101538,,,27,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,GY4SZ,WOS:000448555800038,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

Part I: Modelling and control via simulation,JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Active torque control; iterative learning; roll movement control; spray boom suspension; vibration suppression,FORCE CONTROL; SUSPENSION; DESIGN; DERIVATION; MOVEMENTS; ROLL,"Since one of the influential factors that affects the spray distribution pattern is the spray boom movements which are mostly induced by soil unevenness, most of the recent sprayers are equipped with suspensions for improving the uniformity of spray application in the field. This paper investigates the suitability of improving the sprayer suspension dynamics performance by employing a robust intelligent control scheme, namely active torque control (ATC) based method in reducing the undesired vibration through a simulation study. The ATC scheme with a self-tuning fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (PID) (ATC-STF-PID) controller was first designed and simulated. Then an artificial intelligence (AI) method using iterative learning (IL) was embedded and implemented into the ATC loop to compute the estimated inertial parameter of the system; this scheme is known as ATCAIL. Thereafter, the performance of the ATCAIL scheme is later compared to the ATC with artificial neural network (ATCANN), ATC-STF-PID and STF-PID controllers in time and frequency domains. The results of simulation work affirm that ATC-based schemes can improve the system performance of the active rolling suspension in relation to roll vibration suppression. In other words, both the ATCAIL and ATCANN schemes show better responses in comparison to the ATC-STF-PID controller scheme. The results also imply that the ATCAIL scheme is indeed effective in suppressing the vibration of a sprayer boom structure.","[Tahmasebi, Mona] AREEO, Markazi Agr & Nat Resources Res & Educ Ctr, Agr Engn Res Dept, Arak, Iran; [Mailah, Musa; Abd Rahman, Roslan] UTM, Dept Appl Mech & Design, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Gohari, Mohammad] Arak Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn, Arak, Iran","Tahmasebi, M (corresponding author), AREEO, Markazi Agr & Nat Resources Res & Educ Ctr, Agr Engn Res Dept, Arak, Iran.",tahmasebi.mona@gmail.com,"Tahmasebi, Mona/G-9791-2017; Gohari, Mohammad/I-7723-2017","Tahmasebi, Mona/0000-0001-5413-4870; ",,,,30,8,9,0,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1077-5463,1741-2986,,J VIB CONTROL,J.

In recent times, a number of artificial intelligence scheduling techniques are applied to reduced task execution delay. These techniques have contributed toward the need for an ideal solution. The objective of this study is to optimize task scheduling based on proposed orthogonal Taguchi-based cat swarm optimization (OTB-CSO) in order to reduce total task execution delay. In our proposed algorithm, Taguchi orthogonal approach was incorporated into tracing mode of CSO to scheduled tasks on VMs with minimum execution time. CloudSim tool was used to implement the proposed algorithm where the impact of the algorithm was checked with 5, 10 and 20 VMs besides input tasks and evaluated based on makespan and degree of imbalance metrics. Experimental results showed that for 20 VMs used, our proposed OTB-CSO was able to minimize makespan of the total tasks scheduled across VMs with 42.86, 34.57 and 2.58% improvement over minimum and maximum job first (Min-Max), particle swarm optimization with linear descending inertia weight (PSO-LDIW) and hybrid PSO with simulated annealing (HPSO-SA) and likewise returned degree of imbalance with 70.03, 62.83 and 35.68% improvement over existing algorithms. Results obtained showed that OTB-CSO is effective to optimize task scheduling and improve overall cloud computing performance through minimizing task execution delay while ensuring better system utilization.","[Gabi, Danlami; Ismail, Abdul Samad; Zainal, Anazida; Zakaria, Zalmiyah] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Comp, Dept Comp Sci, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Abraham, Ajith] Sci Network Innovat & Res Excellence, Machine Intelligence Res Labs, Auburn, WA 98071 USA; [Gabi, Danlami] Kebbi State Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Sci & Educ, Dept Comp Sci, Aliero, Kebbi State, Nigeria","Gabi, D (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Comp, Dept Comp Sci, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.; Gabi, D (corresponding author), Kebbi State Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Sci & Educ, Dept Comp Sci, Aliero, Kebbi State, Nigeria.",gabsonley4life@yahoo.ca; abdsamad@utm.my; anazida@gmail.com; zalmiyah@utm.my; ajith.abraham@ieee.org,"GABI, DANLAMI/ABD-8216-2020; Abraham, Ajith/A-1416-2008; Ismail, Abdul Samad/F-5015-2011","GABI, DANLAMI/0000-0001-6159-9588; Abraham, Ajith/0000-0002-0169-6738; Ismail, Abdul Samad/0000-0002-0786-865X",Nigerian Tertiary Education Trust Fund (Tetfund),The first author will like to acknowledge Nigerian Tertiary Education Trust Fund (Tetfund) for their financial support in carrying out this research.,,50,14,14,1,18,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0941-0643,1433-3058,,NEURAL COMPUT APPL,Neural Comput.

First, a total of 66 springs were identified by field surveys, out of which 70% of the spring locations were used for training the models and 30% of the spring locations were employed for the validation process. Second, a total of 14 affecting factors including aspect, altitude, slope, plan curvature, profile curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), sediment transport index (STI), lithology, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use, soil, distance to roads, and distance to streams was used to analyze the spatial relationship between these affecting factors and spring occurrences. Multicollinearity analysis and feature selection of the correlation attribute evaluation (CAE) method were employed to optimize the affecting factors. Subsequently, the novel ensembles of the WoE, LR, and FT models were constructed using the training dataset. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, standard error, confidence interval (CI) at 95%, and significance level P were employed to validate and compare the performance of three models. Overall, all three models performed well for groundwater spring potential evaluation. The prediction capability of the FT model, with the highest AUC values, the smallest standard errors, the narrowest CIs, and the smallest P values for the training and validation datasets, is better compared to those of other models. The groundwater spring potential maps can be adopted for the management of water resources and land use by planners and engineers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Ten continuous and categorical flood conditioning factors were chosen based on the 201 flood locations, including topographic wetness index (TWI), river density, stream power index (SPI), curvature, distance from river, lithology, elevation, ground slope, land use, and rainfall. The step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) model was adopted for the assessment of relationship between flood locations and conditioning factors. The ANFIS model, based on SWARA weights, was employed for providing FSMs with three optimization models to enhance the accuracy of prediction. To evaluate the model performance and prediction capability, root-mean-square error (RMSE) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (area under the ROC (AUROC)) were used. Results showed that ANFIS-IWO with lower RMSE (0.359) had a better performance, while ANFIS-BA with higher AUROC (94.4%) showed a better prediction capability, followed by ANFIS0-IWO (0.939) and ANFIS-CA (0.921).

This paper proposes a route selection scheme over a clustered cognitive radio network (CRN) that enables SUs to form clusters, and a SU source node to search for a route to its destination node. An intrinsic characteristic of CRN is the dynamicity of operating environment in which network conditions (i.e., PUs' activities) change as time goes by. Based on the network conditions, SUs form clusters whose cluster sizes are based on the number of available common channels in a cluster, select a common operating channel for each cluster, and search for a route over a clustered CRN using an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning. Majority of the research related to CRNs has been limited to theoretical and simulation studies, and testbed investigation focusing on physical and data link layers. This investigation is a proof of concept focusing on the network layer of a route selection scheme over a clustered CRN in a universal software radio peripheral (USRP)/ GNU radio platform. Experimental results show that the proposed route selection scheme improves cluster stability by reducing the number of route breakages caused by route switches, and network scalability by reducing the number of clusters in the network without significant deterioration of quality of service, including throughput, packet delivery rate, and end-to-end delay.","[Musavi, Mariam; Yau, Kok-Lim Alvin; Syed, Aqeel Raza] Sunway Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Petaling Jaya 46150, Selangor, Malaysia; [Musavi, Mariam; Mohamad, Hafizal; Ramli, Nordin] MIMOS Berhad Technol Pk Malaysia, Wireless Network & Protocol Res Lab, Kuala Lumpur 57000, Malaysia; [Syed, Aqeel Raza] Hamdard Univ, HIET, FEST, Karachi, Pakistan","Musavi, M (corresponding author), Sunway Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Petaling Jaya 46150, Selangor, Malaysia.",15019318@imail.sunway.edu.my; koklimy@sunway.edu.my; 12010591@imail.sunway.edu.my; hafizal.mohamad@mimos.my; nordin.ramli@mimos.my,"RAMLI, NORDIN/I-9524-2014","RAMLI, NORDIN/0000-0001-5358-284X; Musavi, Mariam/0000-0003-4796-2349",,,,37,4,4,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0140-3664,1873-703X,,COMPUT COMMUN,Comput.

Throughout the literature, traditional and artificial intelligence models have been applied to this task. An attempt to explore and develop better expert models is an ongoing endeavor for this hydrological application. In addition, the accuracy of modeling, confidence and practicality of the model are the other significant problems that need to be considered. Accordingly, this study investigates modern non-tuned machine learning data-driven approach, namely extreme learning machine (ELM). This data-driven approach is containing single layer feedforward neural network that selects the input variables randomly and determine the output weights systematically. To demonstrate the reliability and the effectiveness, one-step-ahead stream-flow forecasting based on three time-scale pattern (daily, mean weekly and mean monthly) for Johor river, Malaysia, were implemented. Artificial neural network (ANN) model is used for comparison and evaluation. The results indicated ELM approach superior the ANN model level accuracies and time consuming in addition to precision forecasting in tropical zone. In measureable terms, the dominance of ELM model over ANN model was indicated in accordance with coefficient determination (R (2)) root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The results were obtained for example the daily time scale R (2) = 0.94 and 0.90, RMSE = 2.78 and 11.63, and MAE = 0.10 and 0.43, for ELM and ANN models respectively.","[Yaseen, Zaher Mundher; Allawi, Mohammed Falah; Jaafar, Othman; Hamzah, Firdaus Mohamad] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Civil & Struct Engn Dept, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Yousif, Ali A.] Univ Duhok, Coll Engn, Water Resources Engn Dept, Duhok, Iraq; [El-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Civil & Struct Engn Dept, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",zahermundher@gmail.com,"Allawi, Mohammed Falah/AAU-1578-2020; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018; El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014","Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505",,,,76,36,36,0,33,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0941-0643,1433-3058,,NEURAL COMPUT APPL,Neural Comput.

The present study developed artificial intelligence model, called Shark Machine Learning Algorithm (SMLA) to provide optimal operational rules. The major objective for the proposed model is minimizing the deficit volume between water releases and the irrigation water demand. The current study compared the performance of the SML model with popular evolutionary computing methods, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The proposed models have been utilized of finding the optimal policies to operate Timah Tasoh Dam, which is located in Malaysia. The study utilized considerable statistical indicators to explore the efficiency of the models. The simulation period showed that SMLA approach outperforms both of conventional algorithms. The SMLA attained high Reliability and Resilience (Rel. = 0.98%, Res. = 50%) and minimum Vulnerability (Vul. = 21.9 of demand).

About 24 previously occurred land subsidence were surveyed and used as training dataset (70% of data) and validation dataset (30% of data) in the modelling process. Each studied model generated a land subsidence susceptibility map (LSSM). The maps were verified using several appropriate tools including statistical indices, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and success rate (SR) and prediction rate (PR) curves.

The idea is to improve the balance between the characteristics of exploration and exploitation in those algorithms in order to address the issues of trapping in local optimal solution, slow convergence, and low accuracy in numerical optimization problems. This article introduces a new hybrid approach by modifying the butterfly adjusting operator in MBO algorithm and uses that as a mutation operator to replace employee phase of the ABC algorithm. The new algorithm is called Hybrid ABC/MBO (HAM). The HAM algorithm is basically employed to boost the exploration versus exploitation balance of the original algorithms, by increasing the diversity of the ABC search process using a modified operator from MBO algorithm. The resultant design contains three components: The first and third component implements global search, while the second one performs local search. The proposed algorithm was evaluated using 13 benchmark functions and compared with the performance of nine metaheuristic methods from swarm intelligence and evolutionary computing: ABC, MBO, ACO, PSO, GA, DE, ES, PBIL, and STUDGA. The experimental results show that the HAM algorithm is clearly superior to the standard ABC and MBO algorithms, as well as to other well-known algorithms, in terms of achieving the best optimal value and convergence speed. The proposed HAM algorithm is a promising metaheuristic technique to be added to the repertory of optimization techniques at the disposal of researchers. The next step is to look into application fields for HAM.","[Ghanem, Waheed A. H. M.; Jantan, Aman] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, George Town, Malaysia; [Ghanem, Waheed A. H.

The former approaches in the ANN model use the connection weights among the input, hidden, and output layers to evaluate the importance of the input variables. The latter methods in the GP model assess the frequency of variables used in the model and the value of fitness for the evaluation. The assessment results identify the percentages of fly ash, water, and soil as important input variables to the output. The percentage of hydroxide and the ratios of silicate to hydroxide and alkali activator to ash are ranked as less important input variables.

One such challenge is compound figures or images made up of two or more subfigures. A deep learning model is proposed for compound figure detection (CFD) in the biomedical article domain. First, pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are selected for transfer learning to take advantage of the image classification performance of CNNs and to overcome the limited dataset of the CFD problem. Next, the pre-trained CNNs are fine-tuned on the training data with early-stopping to avoid overfitting. Alternatively, layer activations of the pre-trained CNNs are extracted and used as input features to a support vector machine classifier. Finally, individual model outputs are combined with score-based fusion. The proposed combined model obtained a best test accuracy of 90.03 and 96.93% outperforming traditional hand-crafted and other deep learning representations on the ImageCLEF 2015 and 2016 CFD subtask datasets, respectively, by using AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19 pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned until best validation accuracy stops increasing combined with the combPROD score-based fusion operator.","[Lee, Sheng Long; Zare, Mohammad Reza] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Informat Technol, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 47500, Subang Jaya, Malaysia","Zare, MR (corresponding author), Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Informat Technol, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 47500, Subang Jaya, Malaysia.",mohammad.reza@monash.edu,,"Lee, Sheng Long/0000-0002-0844-1789",,,,34,5,5,0,21,INST ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY-IET,HERTFORD,"MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE SIX HILLS WAY STEVENAGE, HERTFORD SG1 2AY, ENGLAND",1751-9659,1751-9667,,IET IMAGE PROCESS,IET Image Process.,JUN,2018,12,6,,,,,1031,1037,,10.1049/iet-ipr.2017.0800,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Computer Science; Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,GL6PO,WOS:000437310900021,,,,,11/3/2021

Hence, a precise prediction of AOp has vital importance to minimize or reduce the environmental effects. This paper presents the development of two artificial intelligence techniques, namely artificial neural network (ANN) and ANN based on genetic algorithm (GA) for prediction of AOp. For this purpose, a database was compiled from 97 blasting events in a granite quarry in Penang, Malaysia. The values of maximum charge per delay and the distance from the blast-face were set as model inputs to predict AOp. To verify the quality and reliability of the ANN and GA-ANN models, several statistical functions, i.e., root means square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R (2)) and variance account for (VAF) were calculated. Based on the obtained results, the GA-ANN model is found to be better than ANN model in estimating AOp induced by blasting. Considering only testing datasets, values of 0.965, 0.857, 0.77 and 0.82 for R (2), 96.380, 84.257, 70.07 and 78.06 for VAF, and 0.049, 0.117, 8.62 and 6.54 for RMSE were obtained for GA-ANN, ANN, USBM and MLR models, respectively, which prove superiority of the GA-ANN in AOp prediction. It can be concluded that GA-ANN model can perform better compared to other implemented models in predicting AOp.","[Armaghani, Danial Jahed] UTM, Dept Geotech & Transportat, Fac Civil Engn, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Hasanipanah, Mahdi] Univ Kashan, Dept Min Engn, Fac Engn, Kashan, Iran; [Mahdiyar, Amir] UTM, Dept Struct & Mat, Fac Civil Engn, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Abd Majid, Muhd Zaimi; Tahir, Mahmood M.

Majority of the available literature is limited to systems with low solids concentration, while there has always been a need to investigate the gas-liquid hydrodynamics in tanks handling high solid loadings. Several models have been proposed for predicting k(L)a values, but the application of neuro-fuzzy logic for modeling k(L)a based on combined operational and geometrical conditions is still unexplored. In this paper, an ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system) model was designed to map three operational parameters (agitation speed (RPS), solid concentration, superficial gas velocity (cm/s)) and one geometrical parameter (number of curved blades) as input data, to k(L)a as output data. Excellent performance of ANFIS's model in predicting k(L)a values was demonstrated by various performance indicators with a correlation coefficient of 0.9941.","[Davoody, Meysam; Raman, Abdul Abdul Aziz; Ahmadi, Asgharzadeh; Ali, Seyed; Ibrahim, Binti Shaliza] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Parthasarathy, Rajarathinam] RMIT Univ, Sch Civil Environm & Chem Engn, City Campus 3001, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Raman, AAA (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",azizraman@um.edu.my,"RAMAN, ABDUL AZIZ ABDUL/B-8094-2010; Parthasarathy, Rajarathinam/G-9255-2014","RAMAN, ABDUL AZIZ ABDUL/0000-0001-7586-1903; Parthasarathy, Rajarathinam/0000-0003-3337-8678",University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [PG115-2012B],This research is supported by a Postgraduate Research Fund (PPP) with project number PG115-2012B from the University of Malaya.,,60,0,0,0,1,JIHAD DANESHGAHI,TEHRAN,"PO BOX 13145-1494, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN",1021-9986,,,IRAN J CHEM CHEM ENG,Iran J.

By way of comparison, technologies such as 3D printing, which was introduced about 35 years ago, has seen much wider uptake, to the extent that it is now available to home users and is routinely used in manufacturing. Other technologies, such as immersive reality and artificial intelligence have also seen commercial uptake and acceptance by the general public. In this paper we provide a brief history of EC, recognizing the significant contributions that have been made by its pioneers. We focus on two methodologies (Genetic Programming and Hyper-heuristics), which have been proposed as being suitable for automated software development, and question why they are not used more widely by those outside of the academic community. We suggest that different research strands need to be brought together into one framework before wider uptake is possible.

In the last two decades, the potential of soft computing approaches has increased dramatically in engineering and science problems. In this research, the utility of two soft computing approaches, namely support vector regression (SVR) model and generalized regression neural network (GRNN), is validated to predict 1 day ahead daily river flow data in the upper Senegal River basin at the Bafing Makana station in West Africa. The modeling is conducted by including the climatological information in the modeled stream-flow patterns. Correlation procedure is established and applied to obtain the modeling of the input variables with statistically significant lagged datasets at t - 1, t - 2, and t - 3 used as three input combination for each case study scenario. Different statistical indicators are used to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction models. The results show that the accuracy of the models varied by the scenario and the input datasets, where the SVR model yielded the best results for both modeling scenarios. It is also evident that combining the historical stream-flow data with the rainfall and evapotranspiration can ameliorate substantially the accuracy of the two models for predicting 1-day ahead stream-flow. A comparison of the optimal SVR and GRNN models in this problem indicates that SVR exhibits superior performance to the GRNN model in estimating the daily stream-flow data, irrespective of the modeling scenario and the datasets that is applied. The findings offer an opportunity to apply SVR model for predicting daily stream-flow, with less data requirement for the investigated Senegal River basin.","[Diop, Lamine] UGB, UFR S2ATA, BP 234, St Louis, Senegal; [Diop, Lamine; Brown, Larry C.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Food Agr & Biol Engn, 590 Woody Hayes Dr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Bodian, Ansoumana] UGB, Lab Leidi Dynam Terr & Dev, BP 234, St Louis, Senegal; [Djaman, Koffi] New Mexico State Univ, Agr Sci Ctr Farmington, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, POB 1018, Farmington, NM 87499 USA; [Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Deo, Ravinesh C.] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, ICACS, Inst Agr & Environm IAg&E, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [El-shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",yaseen@tdt.edu.vn,"Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018; Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012; El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014","Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749; El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505",,,,44,26,26,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

Domotization is most commonly applied to the field of energy management, since it gives the possibility of managing the consumption of the devices connected to the electric network, the way in which the users interact with these devices, as well as other external factors that influence consumption. In buildings, Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems have the highest consumption rates. The systems proposed so far have not succeeded in optimizing the energy consumption associated with a HVAC system because they do not monitor all the variables involved in electricity consumption. For this reason, this article presents an agent approach that benefits from the advantages provided by a Multi-Agent architecture (MAS) deployed in a Cloud environment with a wireless sensor network (WSN) in order to achieve energy savings. The agents of the MAS learn social behavior thanks to the collection of data and the use of an artificial neural network (ANN).

In addition, the techniques and methodologies, their limitations and performances are presented in this study. The limitations are addressed as challenges to obtain a set of requirements for Computational Intelligence Medical Data (CIMD) in establishing an efficient CIMD architectural design. The results show that on the one hand Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS) as a single based computational intelligence approach were the best methods in medical applications. On the other hand, the hybridization of SVM with other methods such as SVM-Genetic Algorithm (SVM-GA), SVM-Artificial Immune System (SVM-AIS), SVM-AIRS and fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) had great performances achieving better results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

Among the most widely used welding processes is the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) due to its versatility and simplicity. In fact, the welding process is predominant procedure in the maintenance and repair industry, construction of steel structures and also industrial fabrication. The most important physical characteristics of the weldment are the bead geometry which includes bead height and width and the penetration. Different methods and approaches have been developed to achieve the acceptable values of bead geometry parameters. This study presents artificial intelligence techniques (AIT): For example, radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) models were developed to predict the weld bead geometry. A number of 33 plates of mild steel specimens that have undergone SMAW process are analyzed for their weld bead geometry. The input parameters of the SMAW consist of welding current (A), arc length (mm), welding speed (mm/min), diameter of electrode (mm) and welding gap (mm). The outputs of the AIT models include property parameters, namely penetration, bead width and reinforcement. The results showed outstanding level of accuracy utilizing RBF-NN in simulating the weld geometry and very satisfactorily to predict all parameters in comparison with the MLP-NN model.","[Ahmed, Ali N.] Univ Tenaga Nas, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kajang, Malaysia; [Noor, C.

Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) technique is commonly used to identify oil-filled power transformer fault type but utilisation of artificial intelligence method with optimisation methods has shown convincing results. In this work, a hybrid support vector machine (SVM) with modified evolutionary particle swarm optimisation (EPSO) algorithm was proposed to determine the transformer fault type. The superiority of the modified PSO technique with SVM was evaluated by comparing the results with the actual fault diagnosis, unoptimised SVM and previous reported works. Data reduction was also applied using stepwise regression prior to the training process of SVM to reduce the training time. It was found that the proposed hybrid SVM-Modified EPSO (MEPSO)-Time Varying Acceleration Coefficient (TVAC) technique results in the highest correct identification percentage of faults in a power transformer compared to other PSO algorithms. Thus, the proposed technique can be one of the potential solutions to identify the transformer fault type based on DGA data on site.","[Illias, Hazlee Azil; Liang, Wee Zhao] Univ Malaya, Dept Elect Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Illias, HA (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Elect Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",h.illias@um.edu.my,"Illias, Hazlee/K-2630-2015",,"Ministry of Higher Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [H -16001-D00048]; University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [PG236-2016A]; University of Malaya, MalaysiaUniversiti Malaya [H -16001-D00048]; PPP [PG236-2016A]","This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia H -16001-D00048) to HAI and University of Malaya PG236-2016A to HAI.

DESIGN: Artificial intelligence (neural network) study. METHODS: We assessed 1400 OCT scans of patients with neovascular AMD. Fifteen physical features for each eligible OCT, as well as patient age, were used as input data and corresponding recorded visual acuity as the target data to train, validate, and test a supervised neural network. We then applied this network to model the impact on acuity of defined OCT changes in subretinal fluid, subretinal hyperreflective material, and loss of external limiting membrane (ELM) integrity. RESULTS: A total of 1210 eligible OCT scans were analyzed, resulting in 1210 data points, which were each 16-dimensional. A 10-layer feed-forward neural network with 1 hidden layer of 10 neurons was trained to predict acuity and demonstrated a root mean square error of 8.2 letters for predicted compared to actual visual acuity and a mean regression coefficient of 0.85. A virtual model using this network demonstrated the relationship of visual acuity to specific, programmed changes in OCT characteristics. When ELM is intact, there is a shallow decline in acuity with increasing subretinal fluid but a much steeper decline with equivalent increasing subretinal hyperreflective material. When ELM is not intact, all visual acuities are reduced. Increasing subretinal hyperreflective material or subretinal fluid in this circumstance reduces vision further still, but with a smaller gradient than when ELM is intact. CONCLUSIONS: The supervised machine learning neural network developed is able to generate an estimated visual acuity value from OCT images in a population of patients with AMD. These findings should be of clinical and research interest in macular degeneration, for example in estimating visual prognosis or highlighting the importance of developing treatments targeting more visually destructive pathologies.

However, the dynamic configuration of the induction motor, especially a three-phase induction motor (TIM) is a nonlinear system which is not easy to explain theoretically due to sudden changes in load or speed. Therefore, the development of variable speed drive with a robust switching technique and controller design is compulsory for improving the performance efficiency of the TIM. An advanced switching strategy is used for controlling voltage, frequency, and reducing harmonic output signals while an efficient controller is required to regulate currents, speed, torque, and rotor flux. Nevertheless, the development of such controllers and switching methods need the extensive mathematical model and complex online computation. This paper presents a critical review of the different switching techniques, switching pattern of voltage space vectors and switching time to solve the existing problems and enhance the performance of the TIM. Also, the paper describes the different intelligent controller techniques in terms of scalar control and vector control. Consequently, a comprehensive review on conventional controllers such as proportional integral derivative and artificial intelligence controllers such as an artificial neural network, adaptive neural fuzzy inference system, and fuzzy logic control are explained on their structure, algorithm, and mathematical model. Furthermore, the different integrated circuits of the TIM drive controller are reviewed along with benefits and limitations, current issues and challenges, and conclude with recommendations. All the highlighted insights of this review will hopefully lead to increased efforts toward the development of the advanced switching techniques and controllers for the future induction motor drive.","[Hannan, Mahammad A.; Ker, Pin Jern] Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Power Engn, Coll Engn, Kajang 43000, Malaysia; [Abd Ali, Jamal] Minist Elect, Gen Co Elect Prod Middle Reg, Baghdad 10001, Iraq; [Mohamed, Azah; Lipu, Molla S.

VCC is the realization of autonomous cloud among vehicles to share their abundant resources. VuC is the efficient usage of conventional cloud by on-road vehicles via a reliable Internet connection. Recently, a number of advancements have been made to address the issues and challenges in VCC and VuC. This paper qualitatively reviews CC-V with the emphasis on layered architecture, network component, taxonomy, and future challenges. Specifically, a four-layered architecture for CC-V is proposed including perception, coordination, artificial intelligence and smart application layers. Three network components of CC-V, namely, vehicle, connection, and computation are explored with their cooperative roles. A taxonomy for CC-V is presented considering major themes of research in the area including design of architecture, data dissemination, security, and applications. Related literature on each theme is critically investigated with comparative assessment of recent advances. Finally, some open research challenges are identified as future issues. The challenges are the outcome of the critical and qualitative assessment of the literature on CC-V.","[Aliyu, Ahmed; Abdullah, Abdul Hanan; Kaiwartya, Omprakash; Usman, Mohammed Joda] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Comp, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Cao, Yue] Northumbria Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England; [Kumar, Sushil; Lobiyal, D.

In track cycling event, coach and sports physician are concerned with the performance of the cyclist. The performance prediction may help to fine-tune the cyclist training intensities and strategies planning. This study was conducted to fulfil the prediction requirement by adopting a Fuzzy Inference System to classify the cyclist current cycling performance state. The six levels of output classification by a Fuzzy Inference System are to indicate the athlete's current state performance using the body temperature, heart rate variability and speed as input parameters. An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System was applied to predict the cycling speed that can be achieved in the next lap. Using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System method, the average speed for the next laps can be predicted and compared with the actual speed. The regression value with r=0.9029 indicates the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System is an adequate prediction algorithm to evaluate the cyclist performance. The predicted time to complete compared favourably with the actual finishing time with a +/- 13.6% average error. Hence, the developed system is reliable and suitable for sports events that deal with speed and time.","[Sudin, Sukhairi; Shakaff, Ali Yeon Md; Zakaria, Ammar; Kamarudin, Latifah Munirah; Azmi, Noraini; Saad, Fathinul Syahir Ahmad] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Ctr Excellence Adv Sensor Technol, Lot 19-21, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia; [Sudin, Sukhairi; Shakaff, Ali Yeon Md; Zakaria, Ammar; Salleh, Ahmad Faizal; Kamarudin, Latifah Munirah; Azmi, Noraini; Saad, Fathinul Syahir Ahmad] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Mechatron Engn, Arau, Malaysia","Sudin, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Perlis, Ctr Excellence Adv Sensor Technol, Lot 19-21, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia.",sukhairi.unimap@gmail.com,"Saad, Fathinul Syahir Ahmad/R-5360-2019; Zakaria, Ammar/D-2902-2015; Kamarudin, Latifah Munirah/AAF-9445-2020; Faizal, Ahmad/N-2108-2017","Zakaria, Ammar/0000-0002-7108-215X; Kamarudin, Latifah Munirah/0000-0002-2547-3934; Faizal, Ahmad/0000-0002-5934-8314; Sudin, Sukhairi/0000-0002-7111-7084","Ministry of Higher Education, MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [SRGS 9019-00002, KTP 9011-00023]","This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia [SRGS 9019-00002]; [KTP 9011-00023].",,40,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2474-8668,1474-8185,,INT J PERF ANAL SPOR,Int.

In order to improve the effectiveness of intrusion detection systems (IDSs), data analysis methods such as data mining and classification methods are often integrated with IDSs. Though, numerous studies have contributed in various ways to improve the utilization of data mining for IDS, effective solution often depends on the network setting where the IDS is deployed. In this paper, we propose an efficient IDS based on hybrid heuristic optimization algorithm which is inspired by magnetic field theory in physics that deals with attraction between particles scattered in the search space. Our developed algorithm works in extracting the most relevant features that can assist in accurately detecting the network attacks. These features are extracted by tagged index values that represent the information gain out of the training course of the classifier to be used as a base for our developed IDS. In order to improve the accuracy of artificial neural network (ANN) classifier, we have integrated our proposed hybrid magnetic optimization algorithm-particle swarm optimization (MOA-PSO) technique. Experimental results show that using our proposed IDS based on hybrid MOA-PSO technique provides more accuracy level compared to the use of ANN based on MOA, PSO and genetic algorithm. Updated KDD CUP data set is formed and used during the training and testing phases, where this data set consists of mixed data traffics between attacks and normal activities. Our results show significant gain in terms of efficiency compared to other alternative mechanisms.","[Sadiq, Ali Safaa; Khan, Suleman] Monash Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Bandar Sunway 47500, Malaysia; [Alkazemi, Basem] Umm Al Qura Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Coll Comp & Informat Syst, Mecca 715, Saudi Arabia; [Mirjalili, Seyedali] Griffith Univ, Inst Integrated & Intelligent Syst, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Ahmed, Noraziah] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Comp Syst & Software Engn, Kuantan 26300, Malaysia; [Ahmed, Noraziah] Univ Malaysia Pahang, IBM Ctr Excellence, Kuantan 26300, Malaysia; [Ali, Ihsan] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Pathan, Al-Sakib Khan] Southeast Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dhaka 1213, Bangladesh; [Ghafoor, Kayhan Zrar] Cihan Univ Erbil, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Sci, Erbil 066, Iraq","Sadiq, AS; Khan, S (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Bandar Sunway 47500, Malaysia.",ali.safaa@monash.edu; suleman.khan@monash.edu,"SADIQ, ALI SAFA/M-6514-2016; Pathan, Al-Sakib Khan/AAA-5888-2021; Khan, Suleman/X-3827-2019; Ali, Ihsan/N-7890-2014; Alkazemi, Basem/N-2366-2018; Ghafoor, Kayhan Zrar/F-7524-2010; Mirjalili, Seyedali/P-1372-2018","SADIQ, ALI SAFA/0000-0002-5746-0257; Pathan, Al-Sakib Khan/0000-0001-6572-3451; Ali, Ihsan/0000-0002-9549-2540; Ghafoor, Kayhan Zrar/0000-0001-9046-9475; Mirjalili, Seyedali/0000-0002-1443-9458; Alkazemi, Basem/0000-0003-1260-6811; Khan, Suleman/0000-0002-5725-6184; Khan, Suleman/0000-0003-1190-258X","Department of Computer Science, College of Computer and Information Systems, Umm Al-Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia","This work was supported by the Department of Computer Science, College of Computer and Information Systems, Umm Al-Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia.",,32,12,13,0,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2018,6,,,,,,29041,29053,,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2835166,,,13,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,GJ6UY,WOS:000435521100006,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

Clustering segregates nodes in a network into logical groups called clusters. In CR networks (CRNs), larger cluster size improves network scalability thereby contributing to reduced routing overhead; however, it reduces cluster stability as the number of available common channels in a cluster reduces resulting in increased number of re-clusterings and clustering overhead. This paper presents our proposed first-of-its-kind cluster size adjustment scheme based on an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning. The proposed scheme adapts the cluster size with the amount of white spaces as time goes by in order to improve network scalability and cluster stability in CRNs. Due to the lack of progress in the investigation of cluster size adjustment schemes in the literature, this paper also analyzes their attributes, and then presents such schemes investigated in various kinds of distributed wireless networks. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme improves network scalability by creating larger clusters, and improves cluster stability by reducing the number of re-clusterings (i.e., the number of cluster splits) and clustering overhead, while reducing interference between licensed and unlicensed users in CRNs.","[Javed, Zunera; Yau, Kok-Lim Alvin] Sunway Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Selangor 47500, Malaysia; [Mohamad, Hafizal; Ramli, Nordin] MEMOS Berhad, Wireless Network & Protocol Res Lab, Kuala Lumpur 57000, Malaysia; [Qadir, Junaid] Informat Technol Univ, Lahore 54000, Pakistan; [Ni, Qiang] Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commuicat, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England","Yau, KLA (corresponding author), Sunway Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Selangor 47500, Malaysia.",koklimy@sunway.edu.my,"Yau, Kok Lim Alvin/B-1672-2012; Qadir, Junaid/Q-6329-2019; RAMLI, NORDIN/I-9524-2014; Ni, Qiang/B-4990-2010","Yau, Kok Lim Alvin/0000-0003-3110-2782; Qadir, Junaid/0000-0001-9466-2475; RAMLI, NORDIN/0000-0001-5358-284X; Ni, Qiang/0000-0002-4593-1656","Ministry of Education Malaysia under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) [FRGS/1/2014/ICT03/SYUC/02/2]; Small Grant Scheme (Sunway-Lancaster) [SGSSL-FST-CSNS-0114-05, PVM1204]",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education Malaysia under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Grant FRGS/1/2014/ICT03/SYUC/02/2.

This paper adopts the proposed Wavelet-ARIMA-ANN (WAANN) model and the latest Wavelet-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (WANFIS) model to predict the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at the Langat River Basin for different time scales (1-month, 3-months and 6-months). Model input data pre-processing with wavelet decomposition for improving the performance of the models was carried out apriori. The historical SPEI from 1976 to 2007 were used in the WAANN and WANFIS models for predicting the SPEI for the test period from 2008 to 2015. The Adjusted Coefficient of Determination (R-adj(2)), Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Willmott's Index of Agreement (d) and the Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient of Efficiency (E) were used to assess the models. It was found that the prediction accuracy of the two models improved with time scale length. For the prediction of SPEI-1 (1-month), the errors associated with both models were considered relatively high. Based on the performance measures and graphical plots, the WAANN model is better for the prediction of SPEI-3 and SPEI-6. The WANFIS model had satisfactory prediction of the mid-term drought forecasting for all stations. The WAANN model developed in this study however, gives better accuracy for both, the short-term and mid-term drought forecasting.","[Soh, Y. W.; Koo, C. H.; Huang, Y. F.; Fung, K.

However, the complexity of these processes requires an expert system that involves swarm intelligence-based metaheuristics such as Artificial Algae Algorithm (AAA), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES) and Differential Evolution (DE) for simulation and optimization of the feeding trajectories. DE traditionally performs better than other evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence techniques in optimization of fed-batch fermentation. In this work, an improved version of DE namely Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA) has edged DE and other recent metaheuristics to emerge as superior optimization method. This is shown by the results obtained by comparing the performance of BSA, DE, CMAES, MA and ABC in solving six fed batch fermentation case studies. BSA gave the best overall performance by showing improved solutions and more robust convergence in comparison with various metaheuristics used in this work. Also, there is a gap in the study of fed-batch application of wastewater and sewage sludge treatment. Thus, the fed batch fermentation problems in winery wastewater treatment and biogas generation from sewage sludge are investigated and reformulated for optimization. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The attenuated images of the fruits were acquired using Laser Light Backscattering Imaging (LLBI) with laser diodes emitting light at three wavelengths viz 532, 660, and 830 nm. The elasticity, chlorophyll index and soluble solids content (SSC) of each sample were measured as reference parameters by using a texture analyser, a Delta Absorbance (DA) meter, and a refractometer, respectively. The performance of the extracted features from the selected transform-based image texture analysis for analysing the quality parameters of the fruit was evaluated by means of an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM). The results indicated that there were significant changes of elasticity, chlorophyll index and SSC as the ripening stages increased. Prediction model analysis showed that the Wavelet transform exhibited the most reliable results for all of the reference parameters followed by Tamura and the Gabor transform. The results also revealed that analysis using an ANN approach recorded better performance than SVM as reflected by higher coefficient of determination (R-2) values.

Pathways are used to describe complex processes that involve many parameters. It is important to have an accurate and complete set of parameters that describe the characteristics of a given model. However, measuring these parameters is typically difficult and even impossible in some cases. Furthermore, the experimental data are often incomplete and also suffer from experimental noise. These shortcomings make it challenging to identify the best-fit parameters that can represent the actual biological processes involved in biological systems. Computational approaches are required to estimate these parameters. The estimation is converted into multimodal optimization problems that require a global optimization algorithm that can avoid local solutions. These local solutions can lead to a bad fit when calibrating with a model. Although the model itself can potentially match a set of experimental data, a high-performance estimation algorithm is required to improve the quality of the solutions. This paper describes an improved hybrid of particle swarm optimization and the gravitational search algorithm (IPSOGSA) to improve the efficiency of a global optimum (the best set of kinetic parameter values) search. The findings suggest that the proposed algorithm is capable of narrowing down the search space by exploiting the feasible solution areas. Hence, the proposed algorithm is able to achieve a near optimal set of parameters at a fast convergence speed. The proposed algorithm was tested and evaluated based on two aspartate pathways that were obtained from the BioModels Database. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperformed other standard optimization algorithms in terms of accuracy and near-optimal kinetic parameter estimation. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm is only expected to work well in small scale systems. In addition, the results of this study can be used to estimate kinetic parameter values in the stage of model selection for different experimental conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Classically, WQI is commonly computed using the traditional methods which involved lengthy computation, consume timing and occasionally associated with accidental errors during subindex calculation. Thus, providing an accurate prediction model for WQI is highly required. Recently, the artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been examined for similar prediction applications and exhibited a remarkable ability to capture the nonlinearity pattern between predictors and predictand. In the current research, two different ANN algorithms, namely radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and back propagation neural networks models, have been applied to examine and mimic the relationship of WQI with the water quality variables in a tropical environment (Malaysia). The input variables categorized into two different architectures and have been inspected. In addition, comprehensive analysis for the performance evaluation and the sensitivity analysis of the variables have been conducted. The results achieved are positively promising with high performance accuracy belonging to RBFNN model for both scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed approach offers an effective alternative to compute and predict WQI, to the fact that WQI manual calculation methods involved lengthy computations, transformations, use of various subindex formulae for each value of the constituent water quality variables, and consuming time.","[Hameed, Mohammed; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher; Afan, Haitham Abdulmohsin] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Civil & Struct Engn Dept, Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Sharqi, Saadi Shartooh] Al Anbar Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Al Anbar, Iraq; [Hussain, Aini] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Elect Elect & Syst Engn, Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Elshafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Civil & Struct Engn Dept, Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",zahermundher@gmail.com,"El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018; Hussain, A./D-6915-2017; Hameed, Mohammed Majeed/E-6577-2019; Afan, Haitham Abdulmohsin/G-6932-2018","El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; Hussain, A./0000-0001-7347-7879; Hameed, Mohammed Majeed/0000-0002-9366-9162; Afan, Haitham Abdulmohsin/0000-0002-4957-756X",,,,54,25,26,4,48,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0941-0643,1433-3058,,NEURAL COMPUT APPL,Neural Comput.

In this study, two AI techniques-artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machine (SVM)-were employed to achieve deeper understanding of the salinization process (represented by chloride concentration) in complex coastal aquifers influenced by various salinity sources. Both models were trained using 11 years of groundwater quality data from 22 municipal wells in Khan Younis Governorate, Gaza, Palestine. Both techniques showed satisfactory prediction performance, where the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and correlation coefficient (R) for the test data set were, respectively, about 4.5 and 99.8% for the ANNs model, and 4.6 and 99.7% for SVM model. The performances of the developed models were further noticeably improved through preprocessing the wells data set using a k-means clustering method, then conducting AI techniques separately for each cluster. The developed models with clustered data were associated with higher performance, easiness and simplicity. They can be employed as an analytical tool to investigate the influence of input variables on coastal aquifer salinity, which is of great importance for understanding salinization processes, leading to more effective water-resources-related planning and decision making.","[Alagha, Jawad S.] Islamic Univ Gaza, Gaza, Palestine; [Seyam, Mohammed] Univ Buraimi, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, POB 890,PC 512, Al Buraimi, Oman; [Said, Md Azlin Md] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Civil Engn, Nibong Tebal 14300, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia; [Mogheir, Yunes] Islamic Univ Gaza, Engn Fac, Civil Engn Dept, Gaza, Palestine","Seyam, M (corresponding author), Univ Buraimi, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, POB 890,PC 512, Al Buraimi, Oman.",jawad_s78@yahoo.com; mohseyam@yahoo.com; azlin@eng.usm.my; ymogheir@iugaza.edu.ps,"Said, Azlin/X-9189-2019; Seyam, Mohammed/AAN-6058-2020","Seyam, Mohammed/0000-0002-2521-6508",,,,83,9,9,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1431-2174,1435-0157,,HYDROGEOL J,Hydrogeol.

Frequently, AI methods have been used by researchers to predict output responses of the Resistance spot welding (RSW) due to the complex- ity during the welding process and numerous interferential factors, especially the short-time property of the process. The present study is to investigate the weld strength of spot weld for high strength steel sheets of CR780 using the Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). These results were compared with those obtained by conventional Artificial neural network (ANN). The input parameters were extracted through the dynamic resistance signal which was obtained from the primary circuit of the welding machine. Both the ANN and ANFIS models were utilized for the formulation of mathematical model with an off-line dynamic resistance response of the RSW at a particular parameters setting. The performances of both models were compared in terms of correlation coefficient value (R), Root mean squared error (RMSE), and Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). While both methods were capable of predicting the weld strength, it was found that ANFIS model could predict more precisely than ANN.","[Zaharuddin, Mohd Faridh Ahmad; Kim, Donghyun; Rhee, Sehun] Hanyang Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Zaharuddin, Mohd Faridh Ahmad] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Mat Mfg & Ind Engn, Fac Mech Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Rhee, S (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Seoul, South Korea.",srhee@hanyang.ac.kr,,,"Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE, Korea) under Engineering Development Research Center (EDRC) and Industrial Technology Innovation Program [N0000990, 10063421]; Research Funding Program of Hanyang University","This material is based upon work supported by the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE, Korea) under Engineering Development Research Center (EDRC) and Industrial Technology Innovation Program, No. N0000990 'Ultrasonic welding' and No. 10063421 'Development of the in-line welds quality estimation system and network-based quality control technology in arc and spot welds of ultra-high strength steels for automotive parts assembly.

Hourly SF, rainfall and water level records of a one-year period (2011) were applied to train and test the MLP-based models which comprise six different combinations of input variables. The developed models' performance was evaluated via the training, testing data set and overall data. The results of the performance evaluation criteria, i.e. correlation co-efficient (R) and mean absolute error (MAE) indicates that high prediction accuracy was attained. The best fit MLP model is M6-MLP with the highest R and lowest MAE. The R between the observed and predicted hourly SF by the M6-MLP model is 0.898 and 0.904, while the MAE is 10.922 and 10.83 for the training and testing data sets, respectively. The results demonstrate that the MLP technique is successfully applied with high accuracy for hourly SF prediction.","[Seyam, Mohammed; Othman, Faridah] Univ Malaya, Civil Engn Dept, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Othman, F (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Civil Engn Dept, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",mohseyam@yahoo.com; faridahothman@um.edu,"Seyam, Mohammed/AAN-6058-2020; Othman, Faridah/N-2491-2019","Othman, Faridah/0000-0002-4952-3676; Seyam, Mohammed/0000-0002-2521-6508",,,,31,1,1,1,6,DESALINATION PUBL,HOPKINTON,"36 WALCOTT VALLEY DRIVE,, HOPKINTON, MA 01748 USA",1944-3994,1944-3986,,DESALIN WATER TREAT,Desalin.

Of particular interest are the intersections where traffic bottlenecks are known to occur despite being traditionally signalized. Reinforcement learning (RL), which is an artificial intelligence approach, has been adopted in traffic signal control for monitoring and ameliorating traffic congestion. RL enables autonomous decision makers (e.g., traffic signal controllers) to observe, learn, and select the optimal action (e.g., determining the appropriate traffic phase and its timing) to manage traffic such that system performance is improved. This article reviews various RL models and algorithms applied to traffic signal control in the aspects of the representations of the RL model (i.e., state, action, and reward), performance measures, and complexity to establish a foundation for further investigation in this research field.

These incidents are problematic for commuters who use the public bus system and who often fail to reach their work organisations due to consequent bus strikes. This series of events leads to considerable financial losses for the transport industry. This study proposes and implements safe and fast around the road (SAFAR) which is an intelligent transport Android application developed in collaboration with the local transport authority of Karachi. SAFAR provides run-time information to bus commuters regarding recent violent activities farther up from the current location of the commuters on their route. SAFAR employs live Twitter feeds to classify the manner, location, and casualty information of the violence. The authors investigate SAFAR's performance offline with three named entity recognition (NER) approaches, namely, supervised, dictionary-based, and integrated (hybrid), and show that the integrated approach has the best performance with a precision of 85%. Furthermore, SAFAR recommends alternate routes to commuters if violence is detected farther up through the A-star (A*) algorithm. An online evaluation of SAFAR with 50 real users gave a precision of approximate to 85% to identify violence locations. Finally, a subjective evaluation showed that SAFAR's performance is satisfactory.","[Mahmood, Tariq] Inst Business Adm, Dept Comp Sci, Karachi, Pakistan; [Mujtaba, Ghulam] Sukkur IBA Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Sukkur, Pakistan; [Mujtaba, Ghulam; Shuib, Liyana] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Ali, Nikkishah Zulfiqar] FOLIO3, Business Ctr, PECHS Block 6, Karachi, Pakistan; [Bawa, Amir; Karim, Saima] Natl Univ Comp & Emerging Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Karachi, Pakistan","Mahmood, T (corresponding author), Inst Business Adm, Dept Comp Sci, Karachi, Pakistan.",tmahmood@iba.edu.pk,"Shuib, Liyana/ABH-6159-2020; Shuib, Nor Liyana Mohd/M-8698-2013","Shuib, Liyana/0000-0002-7907-0671; Shuib, Nor Liyana Mohd/0000-0002-7907-0671",University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [RP028F-14AET],This research was supported by the University of Malaya Research Grant (grant no RP028F-14AET).,,26,1,2,0,24,INST ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY-IET,HERTFORD,"MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE SIX HILLS WAY STEVENAGE, HERTFORD SG1 2AY, ENGLAND",1751-956X,1751-9578,,IET INTELL TRANSP SY,IET Intell.

In this work, the authors have conducted a comprehensive survey on battery modelling methods and identified critical areas of improvement vital for estimating the battery capacity. This work proposes the artificial intelligence approach of automated neural networks search (ANS) in development of the robust battery capacity models for the lithium ion batteries based on the inputs (temperature and discharge rates). The robustness in the models is introduced by incorporating uncertainties in the inputs (the temperature and discharge rates, the architecture of algorithm and the models). The statistical analysis and validation of the models reveal that the models formulated using an ANS approach outperform the response surface regression models with correlation coefficient achieved as high as 0.97. The uncertainty analysis based on normal distribution of the inputs suggests that the models formulated from ANS are least sensitive to change in the input conditions when compared to response surface regression models. The global sensitivity analysis reveals that the temperature is a dominant factor for accurate battery capacity estimation.

Recent studies emphasize that artificial intelligence approaches obtain better performance than conventional methods in evaluating the suppliers' performance and determining the best suppliers. Hence, this study proposes a new robust genetic-based intelligent approach, namely gene expression programming (GEP), to improve the supplier selection process for a supply chain and to cope with the drawback of the other intelligent approaches in this area. The applicability of this method was exhibited by a case study in the textile manufacturing industry. To show the performance of the mathematical-genetic model, comparisons with four intelligent techniques, namely multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, radial basis function (RBF) neural network, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and support vector machine (SVM), were performed. The results derived from the intelligent approaches were compared by using a collected dataset from a textile factory. The obtained results demonstrated that first the GEP-based model provides a mathematical model for the suppliers' performance based on the determined criteria, and the developed GEP model is more accurate than the four other intelligent models in terms of accuracy in performance estimation. In addition, to verify the validity of the developed model, different statistical tests were used and the results showed that the GEP model is statistically powerful.","[Fallahpour, Alireza; Musa, Siti Nurmaya] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Wong, Kuan Yew] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Mfg & Ind Engn, Fac Mech Engn, Skudai 81310, Malaysia; [Olugu, Ezutah Udoncy] UCSI Univ, Dept Mech & Mechatron Engn, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Kuala Lumpur 56000, Malaysia","Fallahpour, A (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",fallahpour.a@gmail.com; wongky@fkm.utm.my; Olugu@ucsiuniversity.edu.my; nurmaya@um.edu.my,"OLUGU, EZUTAH U./B-6781-2012; Musa, S.

This paper presents a new method to estimate the size of a crowd. The new algorithm depends on sequential frame differences to estimate the crowd size in a scene. However, relying only on these simple differences adds more constraints for extracting sufficient crowd descriptors. A curvelet transform is employed to achieve that goal. Every two sequential frames are transformed into multi-resolution and multi-direction formats, and then the frame differences are detected at every subband in the curvelet domain. Statistical features out of each subband are then calculated, and the collected features from all subbands are considered as a descriptor vector for the crowd in the scene. Finally, a neural network is manipulated to map the descriptor vectors into predicted counts. The experimental results show that the proposed curvelet statistical features are more robust and provide crowd counting with higher accuracy than previous approaches.","[Hafeezallah, Adel; Abu-Bakar, Syed] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Johor Baharu, Johor, Malaysia; [Hafeezallah, Adel] Taibah Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Madinah, Saudi Arabia","Hafeezallah, A (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Johor Baharu, Johor, Malaysia.; Hafeezallah, A (corresponding author), Taibah Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Madinah, Saudi Arabia.",cdadel@hotmail.com,,,,,,40,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1380-7501,1573-7721,,MULTIMED TOOLS APPL,Multimed.

In this study, the capability of a newly proposed hybrid forecasting model based on the firefly algorithm (FFA) as a metaheuristic optimizer, integrated with the multilayer perceptron (MLP-FFA), is investigated for the prediction of monthly water quality in Langat River basin, Malaysia. The predictive ability of the MLP-FFA model is assessed against the MLP-based model. To validate the proposed MLP-FFA model, monthly water quality data over a 10-year duration (2001-2010) for two different hydrological stations (1L04 and 1L05) provided by the Irrigation and Drainage Ministry of Malaysia are used to predict the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO). The input variables are the chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphate (PO4), total solids, potassium (K), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), electrical conductivity (EC), pH and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N). The proposed hybrid model is then evaluated in accordance with statistical metrics such as the correlation coefficient (r), root-mean-square error, % root-mean-square error and Willmott's index of agreement. Analysis of the results shows that MLP-FFA outperforms the equivalent MLP model. Also, in this research, the uncertainty of a MLP neural network model is analyzed in relation to the predictive ability of the MLP model. To assess the uncertainties within the MLP model, the percentage of observed data bracketed by 95 percent predicted uncertainties (95PPU) and the band width of 95 percent confidence intervals (d-factors) are selected. The effect of input variables on BOD and DO prediction is also investigated through sensitivity analysis. The obtained values bracketed by 95PPU show about 77.7%, 72.2% of data for BOD and 72.2%, 91.6% of data for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. The d-factors have a value of 1.648, 2.269 for BOD and 1.892, 3.480 for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. Based on the values in both stations for the 95PPU and d-factor, it is concluded that the neural network model has an acceptably low degree of uncertainty applied for BOD and DO simulations. The findings of this study can have important implications for error assessment in artificial intelligence-based predictive models applied for water resources management and the assessment of the overall health in major river systems.","[Raheli, Bahare; Aalami, Mohammad Taghi] Univ Tabriz, Dept Civil Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [El-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali] Univ Tabriz, Dept Water Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali] Near East Univ, Fac Engn, Mersin 10, TR-99138 Nicosia, North Cyprus, Turkey; [Deo, Ravinesh C.] Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia","Raheli, B (corresponding author), Univ Tabriz, Dept Civil Engn, Tabriz, Iran.",b.raheli93@ms.tabrizu.ac.ir,"Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali/N-5442-2019; Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012; El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014; Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali/N-5420-2019","Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749; El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505; Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali/0000-0002-0333-2559",,,,69,44,44,4,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

However, these methods are less effective when the non-linearity, complexity, and modeling uncertainties of the system increase. In recent years, a new discipline, known as artificial intelligence-based methods, has emerged, which allows the behavior of the system to be studied using operational data. While single-learner artificial neural network (ANN)-based models demonstrate a satisfactory level of capability in assessing the health of gas turbines, this article investigated the application of a multiple networks artificial neural network (multi-nets ANN) model using a multiple-views multiple learners approach to provide a real-time performance-based automatic fault detection (AFD) system in gas turbine engines. Towards this end, a number of key performance variables, which are commonly measurable on most industrial gas turbine engines, were monitored, and their associated ANNs were trained for healthy conditions. Two back-propagation training algorithms, namely the Levenberg-Marquardt and Bayesian regularization algorithms, and the k-fold cross-validation technique, were employed to train the optimal networks using a training data set. Using the trained multi-nets ANN model, two case studies were conducted pertaining to the detection of drop in compressor flow capacity and compressor fouling in an industrial 18.7-MW twin-shaft gas turbine engine. The ability of all the trained networks of the multi-nets model to detect these faulty conditions was investigated. The results obtained showed that among the four trained networks in the multi-nets model, the associated network for gas generator rotational speed was able to track these incidents earlier. The findings demonstrated the capabilities and performance of the proposed multi-nets model with regard to AFD in industrial gas turbines.","[Tahan, Mohammadreza; Muhammad, Masdi; Karim, Z. A.

Most existing artificial intelligence methods such as neural network, fuzzy logic, and support vector machine (SVM) focus on identifying the fault type, section, and distance separately. Furthermore, studies on fault type identification are focused on overhead transmission systems and not on underground distribution systems. In this paper, a fault location method in the distribution system is proposed using SVM, addressing the limitations of existing methods. Support vector classification (SVC) and regression analysis are performed to locate the fault. The method uses the voltage sag data during a fault measured at the primary substation. The type of fault is identified using SVC. The fault resistance and the voltage sag for the estimated fault resistance are identified using support vector regression (SVR) analysis. The possible faulty sections are identified from the estimated voltage sag data and ranked using the Euclidean distance approach. The proposed method identifies the fault distance using SVR analysis. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed using Malaysian distribution system of 40 buses. Test results show that the proposed method gives reliable fault location.

The proposed algorithm is an extension of eSS with three important improvements in terms of: reference set (RefSet) formation, RefSet combination, and RefSet intensification. Due to the difficulty in estimating kinetic parameter values in the presence of noise and large number of parameters (high-dimension), the aforementioned eSS mechanisms have been improved using combination of quasi-opposition and quasi-reflection, which were under the family of opposition-based learning scheme. The proposed algorithm is tested using one set of benchmark function each from large-scale global optimization (LSGO) problem as well as parameter estimation problem. The LSGO problem consists of 11 functions with 1000 dimensions. For parameter estimation, around 116 kinetic parameters in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and central carbon metabolism of E. coil are estimated. The results revealed that the proposed algorithm is superior to eSS and other competitive algorithms in terms of its efficiency in minimizing objective function value and having faster convergence rate. The proposed algorithm also required lower computational resources, especially number of function evaluations performed and computation time. In addition, the estimated kinetic parameter values obtained from the proposed algorithm produced the best fit to a set of experimental data.","[Remli, Muhammad Akmal; Mohamad, Mohd Saberi] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Comp, Artificial Intelligence & Bioinformat Res Grp, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Deris, Safaai] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Creat Technol & Heritage, Locked Bag 01, Kota Baharu 16300, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Omatu, Sigeru] Osaka Inst Technol, Dept Elect Informat & Commun Engn, Osaka 5358585, Japan; [Corchado, Juan Manuel] Univ Salamanca, Biomed Res Inst Salamanca, BISITE Res Grp, Salamanca, Spain","Mohamad, MS (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Comp, Artificial Intelligence & Bioinformat Res Grp, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",saberi@utm.my,"Corchado, Juan M/D-3229-2013; Carrascosa, Carlos/L-5463-2013; Mohamad, Mohd Saberi/J-3201-2014; Remli, Muhammad Akmal/K-9914-2017","Corchado, Juan M/0000-0002-2829-1829; Carrascosa, Carlos/0000-0003-3649-6530; Mohamad, Mohd Saberi/0000-0002-1079-4559; Remli, Muhammad Akmal/0000-0002-7800-0057",Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [R.J130000.7828.4F886]; GUP Tier 1 Research Grant [Q.J130000.2528.11H05],We would like to thank Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia for supporting this research by a Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (grant number: R.J130000.7828.4F886) and a GUP Tier 1 Research Grant (grant number: Q.J130000.2528.11H05).,,50,12,12,0,12,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0952-1976,1873-6769,,ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL,Eng.

On this basis, optimized GEP (gene expression programming) is applied to precisely formulate the relationships between historical data and electricity consumption. The optimized GEP is a more recent extension of GEP with high probability of finding closed-form solution in mathematical modeling without prior knowledge about the nature of the relationships between variables. This merit is provided by balancing the exploration of solution structure and exploitation of its appropriate weighting factors through use of a robust and efficient optimization algorithm in learning process of GEP. To assess the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method, its estimates are compared with those obtained from ANN (artificial neural network), SVR (support vector regression), ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system), rule-based data mining algorithm, GEP, linear and quadratic models optimized by PSO (particle swarm optimization), CSA (cuckoo search algorithm) and BSA (backtracking search algorithm). The simulation results are validated by actual data sets observed from 1971 until 2011. The results confirm the higher accuracy of the proposed method as compared with other artificial intelligence based models. Future estimations of electrical energy consumption in ASEAN-5 countries are projected up to 2030 according to rolling-based forecasting procedure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

As a 1D method candidate, TS-AMIR used the alphabetic demonstration of secondary-structure elements (SSE) of proteins and compared the assigned letters to each SSE using the n-gram method. Although the results were comparable to those obtained via geometrical methods, the SSE length and accuracy of adjacency between SSEs were not considered in the comparison process. Therefore, to obtain further information on accuracy of adjacency between SSE vectors, the new approach of assigning text to vectors was adopted according to the spherical coordinate system in the present study. Moreover, dynamic programming was applied in order to account for the length of SSE vectors. Five common datasets were selected for method evaluation. The first three datasets were small, but difficult to align, and the remaining two datasets were used to compare the capability of the proposed method with that of other methods on a large protein dataset. The results showed that the proposed method, as a text-based alignment approach, obtained results comparable to both 1D and 3D methods.

Examples for such regulations are 'traffic light ahead' or 'pedestrian crossing' indications. The present investigation targets the recognition of Malaysian road and traffic signs in real-time. Real-time video is taken by a digital camera from a moving vehicle and real world road signs are then extracted using vision-only information. The system is based on two stages, one performs the detection and another one is for recognition. In the first stage, a hybrid color segmentation algorithm has been developed and tested. In the second stage, an introduced robust custom feature extraction method is used for the first time in a road sign recognition approach. Finally, a multilayer artificial neural network (ANN) has been created to recognize and interpret various road signs. It is robust because it has been tested on both standard and non-standard road signs with significant recognition accuracy. This proposed system achieved an average of 99.90% accuracy with 99.90% of sensitivity, 99.90% of specificity, 99.90% of f-measure, and 0.001 of false positive rate (FPR) with 0.3 s computational time.

Pathfinding algorithms are a class of heuristic algorithms based on AI techniques which are used in ES as decision making functions for the purpose of solving problems that would otherwise require human competence or expertise. ES fields that use pathfinding algorithms and operate in real-time face many challenges: for example time constraints, optimality and memory overhead for storing the paths which are found. For these algorithms to work, appropriate problem-specific maps must be constructed. In relation to this, the uniform-cost grid set-up is the most appropriate for ES applications. In this method, each node in a graph is represented as a tile, and the weight between tiles is set at a constant value, usually this is set to 1. In the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms used with this data structure, multiplying the heuristic function by a weight greater than one is well-known technique. In this paper, we present three new techniques using various weights to accelerate heuristic search of grid maps. The first such technique is based on the iteration of a heuristic search algorithm associated with weight-set w. The second technique is based on the length between the start node and goal node, which is then associated with w. The last technique is based on the travel cost and is associated with a weight-set a. These techniques are applicable to a wide class of heuristic search algorithms. Therefore, we implement them, here, within the A*, the Bidirectional A* (Bi-A*) and Jump Point Search UPS) algorithms; thus obtaining a family of new algorithms. Furthermore, it is seen that the use of these new algorithms results in significant improvements over current search algorithms. We evaluate them in path-planning benchmarks and show the amended JPS technique's greater stability, across weight values, over the other two techniques. However, it is also shown that this technique yields poor results in terms of cost solution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This work proposes a hybrid approach of object classification and attribute classification for the produce recognition system which involves the cooperation and integration of statistical approaches and semantic models. The integration of attribute learning into the produce recognition system was proposed due to the fact that attribute learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for bridging the semantic gap and assisting in object recognition in many fields of study. This could tackle problems occurred when less training data are available, i.e. less than 10 samples per class. The experiments show that the correct classification rate of the hybrid approach were 60.55, 75.37 and 86.42% with 2, 4 and 8 training examples, respectively, which were higher than other individual classifiers.

Fixing several attributes based on multi-attribute benchmarking approaches is particularly limited to reliable skin detection. Thus, this study aims to develop a new framework for evaluating and benchmarking skin detection on the basis of artificial intelligent models using multi-criteria analysis. For this purpose, two experiments are conducted. The first experiment consists of two stages: (1) discussing the development of a skin detector using multi-agent learning based on different color spaces to create a dataset of various color space samples for benchmarking and (2) discussing the evaluation and testing the developed skin detector according to multi-evaluation criteria (i.e. reliability, time complexity, and error rate within dataset) to create a decision matrix. The second experiment applies different decision-making techniques (AHP/SAW, AHP/MEW, AHP/HAW, AHP/TOPSIS, AHP/WSM, and AHP/WPM) to benchmark the results of the first experiment (i.e. the developed skin detector). Then, we discuss the use of the mean, standard deviation, and paired sample t-test to measure the correlations among the different techniques based on ranking results.","[Yas, Qahtan M.; Zadain, A.

However, these techniques are limited in their capability to handle a single hypothesis of a problem at a time. The major objective of the reservoir characterization process is to produce models that are robust enough to help improve the accuracy of the predictions of reservoir properties for use in full-field and large-scale simulation models. Research in CI continues to evolve new techniques and paradigms to meet this noble objective. It has been shown that there are uncertainties in the reservoir characterization process as well as the optimal choice of Cl/HIS models parameters. The main challenge is to develop models that are capable of handling multiple hypotheses to reduce the uncertainties thereby ensuring optimal solutions. The ensemble machine learning paradigm has been established to tackle this challenge. This new machine learning technology has not been adequately explored in handling some of the petroleum engineering challenges. This paper rigorously reviews the concept of ensemble learning paradigm, presents successful applications outside petroleum engineering and the geosciences, discusses a few successful attempts in petroleum engineering and the geosciences, and concludes with some recommendations for the much-needed future applications.","[Anifowose, Fatai Adesina] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Ctr Petr & Minerals, Res Inst, Dhahran 31311, Saudi Arabia; [Labadin, Jane] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Comp Sci & IT, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Abdulraheem, Abdulazeez] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Petr Engn, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia; [Anifowose, Fatai Adesina] Saudi Arabian Oil Co, EXPEC Adv Res Ctr, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia","Anifowose, FA (corresponding author), King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Ctr Petr & Minerals, Res Inst, Dhahran 31311, Saudi Arabia.; Anifowose, FA (corresponding author), Saudi Arabian Oil Co, EXPEC Adv Res Ctr, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.",fanifowose@gmail.com,"Labadin, Jane/ABA-1014-2020; Anifowose, Fatai/C-1362-2015","Labadin, Jane/0000-0003-0508-4277; Anifowose, Fatai/0000-0002-1823-8338","King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology through the Science & Technology Unit at King Fand University of Petroleum & Minerals, National Science, Technology and Innovation Plan [11-0IL2144-04]","The authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology through the Science & Technology Unit at King Fand University of Petroleum & Minerals for funding this work under Project No. 11-0IL2144-04 as part of the National Science, Technology and Innovation Plan.",,90,21,23,1,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0920-4105,1873-4715,,J PETROL SCI ENG,J.

However, there is still an insufficiency in ABC regarding its solution search equation, which is good at exploration but poor at exploitation. This drawback can be even more significant when constraints are also involved. To address this issue, an Enhanced Constrained ABC algorithm (EC-ABC) is proposed for Constrained Optimization Problems (COPs) where two new solution search equations are introduced for employed bee and onlooker bee phases respectively. In addition, both chaotic search method and opposition-based learning mechanism are employed to be used in population initialization in order to enhance the global convergence when producing initial population.

This paper proposes two algorithmic components for solving the premature exploitation, i.e. the reactive heuristics and recursive local search technique. The resulting algorithm is tested on two well-known combinatorial optimization problems arising in the artificial intelligence problems field and compared experimentally to six (6) variants of ACO with local search. Results showed that the enhanced algorithm outperforms the six ACO variants.","[Sagban, Rafid] Univ Babylon, Comp Sci Dept, Babylon, Iraq; [Ku-Mahamud, Ku Ruhana; Abu Bakar, Muhamad Shahbani] Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Comp, Coll Arts & Sci, Sintok, Kedah, Malaysia","Sagban, R (corresponding author), Univ Babylon, Comp Sci Dept, Babylon, Iraq.",rsagban@uobabylon.edu.iq,"Sagban, Rafid/P-7738-2015; Sagban, Rafid/I-4507-2019","Sagban, Rafid/0000-0002-3518-1396; ",,,,24,1,1,0,15,TSI PRESS,SAN ANTONIO,"18015 BULLIS HILL, SAN ANTONIO, TX 78258 USA",1079-8587,2326-005X,,INTELL AUTOM SOFT CO,Intell.

In the proposed approach, a Neural Fuzzy inference system (NF) was used to establish the forest fire model whereas Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was adopted to investigate the best values for the model parameters. Tropical forest at the province of Lam Dong (Central Highland of Vietnam) was used as a case study. For this purpose, historic forest fires and ten ignition factors (slope, aspect, elevation, land use, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, distance to road, distance to residence area, temperature, wind speed, and rainfall) were collected from various sources to construct a GIS database, and then, the database was used to develop and validate the proposed model. The performance of the forest model was assessed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, area under the curve (AUC), and several statistical measures. The results showed that the proposed model performs well, both on the training dataset (AUC = 0.932) and the validation dataset (AUC = 0.916). The usability of the proposed model was further assessed through comparisons with those derived from two benchmark state-of-the art machine learning methods, Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Because the performance of the proposed model is better than the two benchmark models, we concluded that the PSO-NF model is a valid alternative tool that should be considered for tropical forest fire susceptibility modeling. The result in this study is useful for forest planning and management in forest fire prone areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Process parameters including initial pH (pH(0)), initial dye concentration (C-0), applied voltage (VEC), initial electrolyte concentration (C-S) and treatment time (t(EC)) were found to be the more effective EC operational parameters to attain maximum decolorization efficiency. In order to investigate the effect of the independent variables on dye removal and determine the optimum condition, gene expression programming (GEP) was used, and the results were compared with the reduced quadratic multiple regression model (SMLR) method. The results indicate that the proposed model predicted the CR% with MARE of 17.28 and RMSE of 6.24, and EnC with MARE of 54.876 and RMSE of 5.33. This model can make more accurate predictions than the SMLR equations. The GEP technique presents two simple equations for predicting CR% and EnC for practical engineering. Also, two different explicit expressions are presented to estimate CR% and EnC as an alternative tool in practical. Moreover, a partial derivative sensitivity analysis was used to indicate the trend of each parameter in the proposed models.","[Akhbari, Azam] Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Bonakdari, Hossein; Ebtehaj, Isa] Razi Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Kermanshah, Iran","Bonakdari, H (corresponding author), Razi Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Kermanshah, Iran.",aazam.akhbari@yahoo.com; bonakdari@yahoo.com; isa.ebtehaj@gmail.com,"Bonakdari, Hossein/B-9305-2018; Ebtehaj, Isa/I-7289-2018","Bonakdari, Hossein/0000-0001-6169-3654; Ebtehaj, Isa/0000-0002-6906-629X",,,,22,5,5,0,2,DESALINATION PUBL,HOPKINTON,"36 WALCOTT VALLEY DRIVE,, HOPKINTON, MA 01748 USA",1944-3994,1944-3986,,DESALIN WATER TREAT,Desalin.

Therefore, it is vital to diagnose the insulation quality to detect early signs of insulation failure. It is well known that there is a correlation between Partial discharge (PD) and the insulation quality. Although many works have been done on PD pattern recognition, it is usually performed in a noise free environment. Also, works on PD pattern recognition in actual cable joint are less likely to be found in literature. Therefore, in this work, classifications of actual cable joint defect types from partial discharge data contaminated by noise were performed. Five crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) cable joints with artificially created defects were prepared based on the defects commonly encountered on site. Three different types of input feature were extracted from the PD pattern under artificially created noisy environment. These include statistical features, fractal features and principal component analysis (PCA) features. These input features were used to train the classifiers to classify each PD defect types. Classifications were performed using three different artificial intelligence classifiers, which include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). It was found that the classification accuracy decreases with higher noise level but PCA features used in SVM and ANN showed the strongest tolerance against noise contamination.","[Raymond, Wong Jee Keen] Tunku Abdul Rahman Univ Coll, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Illias, Hazlee Azil] Univ Malaya, Dept Elect Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Abu Bakar, Ab Halim] Univ Malaya, UM Power Energy Dedicated Adv Ctr UMPEDAC, Wisma R&D UM, Level 4,Jalan Pantai Baharu, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Illias, HA (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Elect Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",h.illias@um.edu.my,"Illias, Hazlee/K-2630-2015; Abu Bakar, Halim/B-8085-2010; Raymond, Wong Jee Keen/K-1535-2016","Raymond, Wong Jee Keen/0000-0002-6656-826X; Illias, Hazlee Azil/0000-0002-5061-1809","Malaysia Ministry of higher EducationMinistry of Education, Malaysia [H-16001-D00048, FP043-2013B]; University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [PG028-2016A]",This work was supported by H-16001-D00048 Malaysia Ministry of higher Education HAI; FP043-2013B Malaysia Ministry of higher Education AHAB; PG028-2016A University of Malaya HAI.,,67,16,16,0,15,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,Jan-13,2017,12,1,,,,,,,e0170111,10.1371/journal.pone.0170111,,,20,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,EH7SJ,WOS:000391972600062,28085953,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,11/3/2021

The spatial database consisted of eighteen conditioning factors that were selected using the information gain ratio (IGR) method. The model was evaluated using quantitative statistical criteria, including the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, root mean squared error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Furthermore, the new model was compared with the NBT, functional tree (FT), logistic model tree (LMT) and reduced-error pruning tree (REPTree) soft computing benchmark models. The findings indicated that the RF-NBT model showed an increased prediction accuracy relative to the NBT model using both the training and validation datasets, and the RF-NBT model exhibited a greater capability for landslide susceptibility mapping. The new RF-NBT model also showed the most preferable results compared with the FT, LMT and REPTree models. Finally, an analysis of the landslide density (LD) using the RF-NBT model demonstrated that the very high susceptibility (VHS) class had the highest LD (3.552) among the landslide susceptibility maps. These results can be used for the planning and management of areas vulnerable to landslides in order to prevent damages caused by such natural disasters.","[Chen, Wei; Zhang, Shuai; Zhang, Ning] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geol & Environm, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wei] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Shandong Prov Key Lab Deposit Mineralizat & Sedim, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Shirzadi, Ataollah] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Watershed Sci Engn, Sanandaj, Iran; [Shahabi, Himan] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj, Iran; [Bin Ahmad, Baharin] UTM, Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Dept Geoinformat, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Hong, Haoyuan] Nanjing Normal Univ, Key Lab Virtual Geograph Environm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hong, Haoyuan] State Key Lab Cultivat Base Geog Environm Evolut, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ning] Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Shahabi, H (corresponding author), Univ Kurdistan, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Geomorphol, Sanandaj, Iran.",h.shahabi@uok.ac.ir,"Jani, Arpit/B-5376-2017; Shahabi, Himan/J-1591-2017; ????, Wei Chen/ABB-8669-2020; Shirzadi, Ataollah/AAX-9800-2020; Hong, Haoyuan/C-8455-2014","Shahabi, Himan/0000-0001-5091-6947; Hong, Haoyuan/0000-0001-6224-069X; Shirzadi, Ataollah/0000-0003-1666-1180",China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017 M613168]; Scientific Research Program - Shaanxi Provincial Education Department [17JK0511]; Open Fund of Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Depositional Mineralization AMP; Sedimentary Minerals [DMSM2017029]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) [Q.J130000.2527.17H84],"This study was supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [grant number 2017 M613168], the Scientific Research Program Funded by Shaanxi Provincial Education Department [grant number 17JK0511], the Open Fund of Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Depositional Mineralization & Sedimentary Minerals [grant number DMSM2017029], and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) based on Research University [grant number Q.J130000.2527.17H84].",,88,97,97,6,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1947-5705,1947-5713,,GEOMAT NAT HAZ RISK,Geomat.

Although ABC has fewer tuned parameters, making it an easy-to-use tool, it has shown better performance than other prominent optimisation algorithms such as differential evolution (DE), evolutionary algorithms (EA) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithms at solving optimisation problems. Despite these advantages, researchers have found that the standard ABC actually suffers from slow convergence speed on unimodal functions and is often trapped in local minima of multimodal functions. Most problematically, it does not balance the exploitation and exploration stages, leading to various inefficiencies in terms of capability. This paper presents a new ABC variant referred to as JA-ABC4b, which has been formulated to balance exploitation and exploration in order to boost optimisation performance. JA-ABC4b has been experimentally tested on 27 benchmark functions and economic environmental dispatch (EED) problems. The results have revealed a robust performance of JA-ABC4b in comparison to other existing ABC variants and other optimisation algorithms.","[Sulaiman, Noorazliza; Mohamad-Saleh, Junita] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Nibong Tebal 14300, Penang, Malaysia; [Abro, Abdul Ghani] King Saud Univ, Coll Engn, Al Muzahimiyah Campus, Riyadh 12372, Saudi Arabia","Mohamad-Saleh, J (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Nibong Tebal 14300, Penang, Malaysia.",noorazlizasulaiman@gmail.com; jms@usm.my; ghaniabro@gmail.com,"Mohamad-Saleh, Junita/D-2724-2019","Mohamad-Saleh, Junita/0000-0003-3447-6050; Sulaiman, Noorazliza/0000-0002-9580-0427",Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) FRGS [203/PELECT/6071247]; Universiti Sains MalaysiaUniversiti Sains Malaysia,The authors acknowledge the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) FRGS Grant No: 203/PELECT/6071247 and Universiti Sains Malaysia for the financial and facilities support.,,31,5,5,1,7,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",1758-0366,1758-0374,,INT J BIO-INSPIR COM,Int.

This study utilizes the swarm intelligence technique through the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to optimize the energy consumption in a dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol in MANET. The proposed algorithm is called bee DSR (BEEDSR). The ABC algorithm is used to identify the optimal path from the source to the destination to overcome energy problems. The performance of the BEEDSR algorithm is compared with DSR and bee-inspired protocols (BeeIP). The comparison was conducted based on average energy consumption, average throughput, average end-to-end delay, routing overhead, and packet delivery ratio performance metrics, varying the node speed and packet size.

In recent years, video surveillance systems of crowd scenes have witnessed an increased demand in different applications, such as safety, security, entertainment, and personal mental health. Although many methods have been proposed, certain limitations exist, and many unresolved issues remain open. In this paper, we proposed a novel spatio-temporal sparse coding representation, based on sparse coded features with k-means singular value decomposition for robust classification of crowd behaviors. Extensive experiments have shown that dictionary learning method with sparsely coded features captured vital structures of video scenes and yielded discriminant descriptors for classifications than conventional bag-of-visual-features. Relying on the measurable features of crowd scenes and motion characteristics, we can represent different attributes of the crowd scenes. Experiments on hundreds of video scenes were carried out on publicly available datasets. Quantitative evaluation indicates that the proposed model display superior accuracy, precision, and recall in classifying human behaviors with linear support vector machine when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

In this algorithm the solutions are filtered in a rate that is calculated based on the mean of objective functions of all solutions in the current population of each iteration. The filtered solutions as the better solutions are moved to filtered blood and the rest are transferred to waste representing the worse solutions. This is a simulation of the glomerular filtration process in the kidney. The waste solutions are reconsidered in the iterations if after applying a defined movement operator they satisfy the filtration rate, otherwise it is expelled from the waste solutions, simulating the reabsorption and excretion functions of the kidney. In addition, a solution assigned as better solution is secreted if it is not better than the worst solutions simulating the secreting process of blood in the kidney. After placement of all the solutions in the population, the best of them is ranked, the waste and filtered blood are merged to become a new population and the filtration rate is updated. Filtration provides the required exploitation while generating a new solution and reabsorption gives the necessary exploration for the algorithm. The algorithm is assessed by applying it on eight well-known benchmark test functions and compares the results with other algorithms in the literature. The performance of the proposed algorithm is better on seven out of eight test functions when it is compared with the most recent researches in literature.

The path coefficient analysis is implemented on linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic models to determine the optimized weighting factors. On this basis, artificial cooperative search algorithm is developed to provide better-fit solution and improve the accuracy of estimation. Artificial cooperative search algorithm is a recently developed evolutionary algorithm with high probability of finding optimal solution in complex optimization problems. This merit is provided by balancing exploitation of better results and exploration of the problem's search space through use of a single control parameter and two advanced crossover and mutation operators. To assess the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method, it is compared with genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, imperialist competitive algorithm, cuckoo search, simulated annealing, and differential evolution. The simulation results are validated by actual data sets obtained from 1992 until 2013. The results confirm the higher accuracy and reliability of the proposed method in electric power consumption forecasting as compared with other optimization methods. Future estimation of Iran's electric energy consumption is then projected up to 2030 according to three different scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Kaboli, S. Hr.

The motivation for exploring and developing expert predictive models is an ongoing endeavor for hydrological applications. In this study, the potential of a relatively new data-driven method, namely the extreme learning machine (ELM) method, was explored for forecasting monthly stream-flow discharge rates in the Tigris River, Iraq. The ELM algorithm is a single-layer feedforward neural network (SLFNs) which randomly selects the input weights, hidden layer biases and analytically determines the output weights of the SLFNs. Based on the partial autocorrelation functions of historical stream-flow data, a set of five input combinations with lagged stream-flow values are employed to establish the best forecasting model. A comparative investigation is conducted to evaluate the performance of the ELM compared to other data-driven models: support vector regression (SVR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The forecasting metrics defined as the correlation coefficient (r), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E-Ns), Willmott's Index (WI), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) computed between the observed and forecasted stream-flow data are employed to assess the ELM model's effectiveness. The results revealed that the ELM model outperformed the SVR and the GRNN models across a number of statistical measures. In quantitative terms, superiority of ELM over SVR and GRNN models was exhibited by E-Ns = 0.578, 0.378 and 0.144, r = 0.799, 0.761 and 0.468 and WI = 0.853, 0.802 and 0.689, respectively and the ELM model attained lower RMSE value by approximately 21.3% (relative to SVR) and by approximately 44.7% (relative to GRNN). Based on the findings of this study, several recommendations were suggested for further exploration of the ELM model in hydrological forecasting problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, efficient identification of informative genes is inevitable. Embedded methods like penalized classifiers have been used for microarray analysis due to their embedded gene selection. This paper proposes an improved penalized support vector machine with absolute t-test weighting scheme to identify informative genes and pathways. Experiments are done on four microarray data sets. The results are compared with previous methods using 10-fold cross validation in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F-score.

The conventional gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is a memory-less heuristic optimization algorithm based on Newton's laws of gravitation. Therefore, the positions of agents only depend on the optimal solutions of previous iteration. In GSA, there is always a chance to lose optimal trajectory because of not utilizing the best solution from previous iterations of the optimization process. This drawback reduces the performance of GSA when dealing with complicated optimization problems. However, the MBGSA uses the overall best solution of the agents from previous iterations in the calculation of agents' positions. Consequently, the agents try to improve their positions by always searching around overall best solutions. The performance of the MBGSA is evaluated by solving fourteen standard benchmark optimization problems and the results are compared with GSA and modified GSA (MGSA). It is also applied to adaptive beamforming problems to improve the weight vectors computed by Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) algorithm as a real world optimization problem. The proposed algorithm demonstrates high performance of convergence compared to GSA and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Due to the importance of providing a secure and economic electricty for the consumers, having a reliable and robust enough forecast engine in short-term load management is very needful. Fuzzy inference system is one of primal branches of Artificial Intelligence techniques which has been widely used for different applications of decision making in complex systems. This paper aims to develop a Fuzzy inference system as a main forecast engine for Short term Load Forecasting (STLF) of a city in Iran. However, the optimization of this platform for this special case remains a basic problem. Hence, to address this issue, the Radial Movement Optimization (RMO) technique is proposed to optimize the whole Fuzzy platform. To support this idea, the accuracy of the proposed model is analyzed using MAPE index and an average error of 1.38% is obtained for the forecast load demand which represents the reliability of the proposed method. Finally, results achieved by this method, demonstrate that an adaptive two-stage hybrid system consisting of Fuzzy & RMO can be an accurate and robust enough choice for STLF problems.

The proposed Bat algorithm-based LM (BALM) was simulated on 10 benchmark datasets. For evaluation of the proposed BALM, comparative simulation experiments were conducted. The experimental results indicated that the BALM was found to deviate from the limitations of the LM to advance the accuracy and convergence speed of the ANN. Also, the BALM performs better than the back-propagation algorithm, artificial bee colony trained back-propagation ANN, and artificial bee colony trained LM ANN.

Forecasting and predicting of monthly streamflows are investigated by using three heuristic regression techniques, least square support vector regression (LSSVR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and M5 Model Tree (M5-Tree). Data from four different stations, Besiri and Malabadi located in Turkey, Hit and Baghdad located in Iraq, are used in the analysis. Cross validation method is employed in the applications. In the first stage of the study, the heuristic regression models are compared with each other and multiple linear regression (MLR) in forecasting one month ahead streamflow of each station, individually. In the second stage, the models are evaluated and compared in predicting streamflow of one station using data of nearby station. The research investigated also the influence of the periodicity component (month number of the year) as an external sub-set in modeling long-term streamflow. In both stages, the comparison results indicate that the LSSVR model generally performs superior to the MARS, M5-Tree and MLR models. In addition, it is seen that adding periodicity as input to the models significantly increase their accuracy in forecasting and predicting monthly streamflows in both stages of the study.","[Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Kisi, Ozgur; Demir, Vahdettin] Canik Basari Univ, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Civil Engn, TR-55080 Samsun, Turkey","Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",zahermundher@gmail.com,"Kisi, Ozgur/AAD-8932-2019; Demir, Vahdettin/AAD-3764-2020; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018","Demir, Vahdettin/0000-0002-6590-5658; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; Kisi, Ozgur/0000-0001-7847-5872",,,,51,42,42,3,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

In the new approach, the neural fuzzy inference system was used to create an initial flood susceptibility model and then the model was optimized using two metaheuristic algorithms, Evolutionary Genetic and Particle Swarm Optimization. A high-frequency tropical cyclone area of the Tuong Duong district in Central Vietnam was used as a case study. First, a GIS database for the study area was constructed. The database that includes 76 historical flood inundated areas and ten flood influencing factors was used to develop and validate the proposed model. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to assess the model performance and its prediction capability. Experimental results showed that the proposed model has high performance on both the training (RMSE = 0.306, MAE = 0.094, AUC = 0.962) and validation dataset (RMSE = 0.362, MAE = 0.130, AUC = 0.911). The usability of the proposed model was evaluated by comparing with those obtained from state-of-the art benchmark soft computing techniques such as J48 Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System. The results show that the proposed MONF model outperforms the above benchmark models; we conclude that the MONF model is a new alternative tool that should be used in flood susceptibility mapping. The result in this study is useful for planners and decision makers for sustainable management of flood-prone areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A case study using the 1-year database consisting of PV power output, global irradiance, module temperature, and other relevant variables obtained from Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka is used to develop forecast models for three typical weather conditions-clear, cloudy, and overcast sky conditions. A machine learning method (Support Vector Regression-SVR) and an Artificial Neural Network method (nonlinear autoregressive) are used to produce the models and the results are compared with a benchmark model using the persistence method. Comparison with all the variables suggests that tilted global horizontal irradiance (GHI(tilt)) and module temperature (T-mod) are the essential input variables to forecast the PV power output. It has also been observed that SVR performs well across all types of sky conditions, with the forecasting skill values between 0.65 and 0.79 when compared to the benchmark persistence method.

The common methods of DGA are IEC 60599 method, Doenenberg's ratio method and Roger's ratio method. The accuracy of the DGA diagnosis will determine the cost, duration and workload of the maintenance since it can influence the error in the maintenance. Although DGA methods have been used widely, sometimes they still yield incorrect diagnosis results. Thus, many works on transformer fault diagnosis have been proposed previously, which include artificial intelligence methods, to improve the accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis. However, the accuracy of the previously reported works is believed to have rooms for improvement. Therefore, in this work, hybrid modified evolutionary particle swarm optimisation-time varying acceleration coefficient (MEPSO-TVAC)-artificial neural network (ANN) was proposed for transformer fault diagnosis based on dissolved gas data. This is due to these two methods have never been proposed for transformer fault diagnosis in the past. The performance of the ANN was optimised through the proposed MEPSO-TVAC. The superiority of the proposed method was demonstrated through comparison with the existing DGA methods, unoptimised ANN and previously reported methods in literatures. The comparison shows that the proposed hybrid MEPSO-TVAC-ANN obtained the highest accuracy among all methods, which can then be used for power transformer fault diagnosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The metaheuristic algorithm is able to find near-optimal solutions within a reasonable amount of iterations. The modifications are accomplished in two ways initialization of harmony memory and improvisation of solutions. The proposed algorithm is tested and verified using UCI benchmark data sets, as well as two real life binary classification problems, namely epileptic seizure detection and prediction.

The communications among neurons are essentially achieved by spikes, i.e. short electrical pulses. In terms of motivation, SN P systems fall into the third generation of neural network models. In this study, a novel variant of SN P systems, namely SN P systems with self-organization, is introduced, and the computational power of the system is investigated and evaluated. It is proved that SN P systems with self-organization are capable of computing and accept the family of sets of Turing computable natural numbers. Moreover, with 87 neurons the system can compute any Turing computable recursive function, thus achieves Turing universality.

Analyzing the unique linguistic features of Hadiths (e.g. ancient Arabic language and story-like text) results to compile and utilize specific natural language processing methods. In the literature, no study is solely focused on Hadith from artificial intelligence perspective, while many new developments have been overlooked and need to be highlighted. Therefore, this review analyze all academic journal and conference publications that using two main methods of artificial intelligence for Hadith text: Hadith classification and mining. All Hadith relevant methods and algorithms from the literature are discussed and analyzed in terms of functionality, simplicity, F-score and accuracy. Using various different Hadith datasets makes a direct comparison between the evaluation results impossible. Therefore, we have re-implemented and evaluated the methods using a single dataset (i.e. 3150 Hadiths from Sahih Al-Bukhari book). The result of evaluation on the classification method reveals that neural networks classify the Hadith with 94% accuracy. This is because neural networks are capable of handling complex (high dimensional) input data. The Hadith mining method that combines vector space model, Cosine similarity, and enriched queries obtains the best accuracy result (i.e. 88%) among other re-evaluated Hadith mining methods. The most important aspect in Hadith mining methods is query expansion since the query must be fitted to the Hadith lingo. The lack of knowledge based methods is evident in Hadith classification and mining approaches and this absence can be covered in future works using knowledge graphs.","[Saloot, Mohammad Arshi; Idris, Norisma; Mahmud, Rohana; Ja'afar, Salinah; Gani, Abdullah] Univ Malaya, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Thorleuchter, Dirk] Inst Fraunhofer INT, Appelsgarten 2, D-53879 Euskirchen, Germany","Saloot, MA (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",phd_siamak@yahoo.com; norisma@um.edu.my; rohanamahmud@um.edu.my; b1salina@um.edu.my; dirk.thorleuchter@int.fraunhofer.de; abdullah@um.edu.my,"IDRIS, NORISMA/B-9373-2010; Mahmud, Rohana/B-9588-2010; Gani, Abdullah/C-2888-2009","Mahmud, Rohana/0000-0002-8286-3891; Gani, Abdullah/0000-0002-4388-020X",University of Malaya UMRG Grant [RP003C-14HNE],The research for this paper was financially supported by the University of Malaya UMRG Grant (RP003C-14HNE).,,53,21,21,2,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-2821,1573-7462,,ARTIF INTELL REV,Artif.

Developing a predictive model of bearing capacity for this kind of foundation is of interest due to the fact that the famous bearing capacity equations are proposed for conventional footings. Many studies underlined the applicability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in predicting the bearing capacity of foundations. However, the majority of these models are built using conventional ANNs, which suffer from slow rate of learning as well as getting trapped in local minima. Moreover, they are mainly developed for conventional footings. The prime objective of this study is to propose an improved ANN-based predictive model of bearing capacity for thin-walled shallow foundations. In this regard, a relatively large dataset comprising 145 recorded cases of related footing load tests was compiled from the literature. The dataset includes bearing capacity (Q(u)), friction angle, unit weight of sand, footing width, and thin-wall length to footing width ratio (L-w/B). Apart from Q(u), other parameters were set as model inputs. To enhance the diversity of the data, four more related laboratory footing load tests were conducted on the Johor Bahru sand, and results were added to the dataset. Experimental findings suggest an almost 0.5 times increase in the bearing capacity in loose and dense sands when L-w/B is increased from 0.5 to 1.12. Overall, findings show the feasibility of the ANN-based predictive model improved with particle swarm optimization (PSO). The correlation coefficient was 0.98 for testing data, suggesting that the model serves as a reliable tool in predicting the bearing capacity.","[Rezaei, Hossein; Momeni, Ehsan] Lorestan Univ, Fac Engn, Khorramabad 6815144316, Iran; [Nazir, Ramli; Momeni, Ehsan] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Geotech & Transportat, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia","Momeni, E (corresponding author), Lorestan Univ, Fac Engn, Khorramabad 6815144316, Iran.; Momeni, E (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Geotech & Transportat, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia.",mehsan23@live.utm.my,"Momeni, Ehsan/K-4940-2013","Momeni, Ehsan/0000-0003-4084-485X","Science Fund of Malaysian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation [4S077]","Project supported by the Science Fund of Malaysian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (No. #4S077)",,62,15,15,3,31,ZHEJIANG UNIV,HANGZHOU,"EDITORIAL BOARD, 20 YUGU RD, HANGZHOU, 310027, PEOPLES R CHINA",1673-565X,1862-1775,,J ZHEJIANG UNIV-SC A,J.

Hence, the evaluation and selection of the right suppliers have become a central decision of manufacturing business activities around the world. Consequently, numerous individual and integrated methods have been presented to evaluate and select suppliers. The current literature shows that hybrid artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have received much attention for supplier evaluation. Integrated data envelopment analysis-artificial neural network (DEA-ANN) is one of the combined methods that have recently garnered great attention from academics and practitioners. However, DEA-ANN model has some drawbacks, which make some limitation in the evaluation process. In this study, we aim at improving the previous DEA-AI models by integrating the Kourosh and Arash method as a robust model of DEA with a new AI approach namely genetic programming (GP) to overcome the shortcomings of previous DEA-AI models in supplier selection. Indeed, in this paper, GP provides a robust nonlinear mathematical equation for the suppliers' efficiency using the determined criteria. To validate the model, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system as a powerful tool was used to compare the result with GP-based model. In addition, parametric analysis and unseen data set were used to validate the precision of the model.","[Fallahpour, Alireza; Olugu, Ezutah Udoncy; Musa, Siti Nurmaya] Univ Malaya, Dept Mech Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Khezrimotlagh, Dariush] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm Bldg, Dept Appl Stat, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Wong, Kuan Yew] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Mfg & Ind Engn, Skudai 81310, Malaysia","Olugu, EU (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Mech Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",fallahpour.a@gmail.com; olugu@um.edu.my; nurmaya@um.edu.my; dariush@um.edu.my; wongky@fkm.utm.my,"Wong, Kuan Yew/D-1577-2010; Musa, S.

In this research work, a new hybrid approach combined the extreme learning machine (ELM) with wavelet transform (WT) algorithm is proposed to predict daily dew point temperature. To test the validity of the proposed approach, the daily weather data sets for port of Bandar Abass situated in the south costal part of Iran are used. The merit of the proposed ELM-WT method is verified against the ELM, support vector machines and artificial neural network techniques based upon several well-known statistical indicators. The achieved results demonstrate that the hybrid ELM-WT method presents absolute superiority over other powerful techniques applied. It is found that among four considered sets of parameters with 1, 2 and 3 inputs, further accuracy can be achieved using combination of average ambient temperature (T-avg) and relative humidity (R-h). For the best ELM-WT model using Tavg and Rh as inputs, the statistical indicators of mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute bias error, root mean square error and coefficient of determination are 6.1664 %, 0.5495, 0.7621 and 0.9953 degrees C, respectively. Based on relative percentage error (RPE), for the best ELM-WT model 91 % of the predictions fall within the RPE acceptable range of -10 and + 10 %. In a nutshell, the results of this study convincingly advocate that coupling the ELM with WT would be particularly appealing to offer accurate predictions and favorable enhancement in the precision of ELM.","[Amirmojahedi, Mohsen] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Mohammadi, Kasra] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Shamshirband, Shahaboddin; Kamsin, Amirrudin] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst & Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Danesh, Amir Seyed] Payame Noor Univ, Rasht Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Mostafaeipour, Ali] Yazd Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Yazd, Iran","Mohammadi, K (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.; Shamshirband, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst & Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",kmohammadi@umass.edu; shamshirband@um.edu.my; a.seyeddanesh@gmail.com,"S.Band, Shahab/ABI-7388-2020","Shamshirband, Shahaboddin/0000-0002-6605-498X",,,,61,12,12,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

Adaptation of cloud computing services for robotic applications is relatively straightforward while adaptation of underlying ideas will require a new design attitude. Cloud computing is a cost-effective and dynamic business model. Currently cloud robotics is understood as a client server methodology which enables robots utilize resources and services placed at centralized servers. These cloud servers treat robots as any other client computer offering them platform, infrastructure, process or algorithm as a service. HTM5 is an OMG MDA based multi-view meta-model for agent oriented development of cloud robotic systems. HTM5 encourages design of peer-to-peer service ecosystems based on an open registry and matchmaking mechanism. In peer-to-peer cloud robotics, a robot can trade its hardware, software and functional resources as a service to other robots in the ecosystem. The peer-to-peer trade in such systems may be driven by contracts and relationships between its member agents. This article discusses trade-view model of HTM5 methodology and its use in developing a cloud robotic ecosystem that implements peer-to-peer, contract based economy. The article also presents a case study with experiments that implement distributed artificial intelligence and peer-to-peer service oriented trade on simulated and real robot colonies.","[Nagrath, Vineet; Morel, Olivier; Meriaudeau, Fabrice] UMR CNRS 6306, Lab Le2i, F-71200 Le Creusot, France; [Malik, Aamir Saeed; Saad, M.

Diagnosis based on cultured specimens is the reference standard; however, results take weeks to obtain. Slow and insensitive diagnostic methods hampered the global control of tuberculosis, and scientists are looking for early detection strategies, which remain the foundation of tuberculosis control. Consequently, there is a need to develop an expert system that helps medical professionals to accurately diagnose the disease. The objective of this study is to diagnose tuberculosis using a machine learning method. Artificial immune recognition system (AIRS) has been used successfully for diagnosing various diseases. However, little effort has been undertaken to improve its classification accuracy. In order to increase the classification accuracy, this study introduces a new hybrid system that incorporates real tournament selection mechanism into the AIRS. This mechanism is used to control the population size of the model and to overcome the existing selection pressure. Patient epacris reports obtained from the Pasteur laboratory in northern Iran were used as the benchmark data set. The sample consisted of 175 records, from which 114 (65 %) were positive for TB, and the remaining 61 (35 %) were negative. The classification performance was measured through tenfold cross-validation, root-mean-square error, sensitivity, and specificity. With an accuracy of 100 %, RMSE of 0, sensitivity of 100 %, and specificity of 100 %, the proposed method was able to successfully classify tuberculosis cases.

The existing handover triggering scheme for LTE is not flexible enough to incorporate new performance metrics, and it introduces handover latency. There are studies on non-conventional handoff algorithms for LTE applications, for instance, the fuzzy logic approach. However, the fuzzy logic approach needs regular manual tuning to constantly produce optimal output. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing an adaptive fuzzy logic-based handoff decision algorithm, which can cope with environmental changes and improve efficiency by reducing human intervention. Performance results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce unnecessary handovers by about 20% compared with the fuzzy logic and conventional LTE handover triggering scheme, leading to reduced packet loss rates.","[Kwong, Chiew Foong; Akbari-Moghanjoughi, Ayyoub] INTI Int Univ, Fac Sci Technol Engn & Math, Nilai, Malaysia; [Chuah, Teong Chee; Tan, Su Wei] Multimedia Univ, Fac Engn, Cyberjaya, Malaysia","Kwong, CF (corresponding author), INTI Int Univ, Fac Sci Technol Engn & Math, Nilai, Malaysia.",chiewfoong.kwong@newinti.edu.my,"Kwong, Chiew-Foong/ABH-6865-2020; Akbari-Moghanjoughi, Ayyoub/C-9172-2011","Kwong, Chiew-Foong/0000-0001-7857-511X; Akbari-Moghanjoughi, Ayyoub/0000-0002-4947-5707",,,,18,6,6,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0266-4720,1468-0394,,EXPERT SYST,Expert Syst.,FEB,2016,33,1,,,,,30,45,,10.1111/exsy.12120,,,16,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,DD8MX,WOS:000370182100003,,,,,11/3/2021

In this paper, considering the robustness of artificial intelligence methods utilized in engineering problems, an artificial neural network (ANN) was applied to predict rock fragmentation and back-break; an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm was also utilized to optimize the blasting pattern parameters. In this regard, blasting parameters, including burden, spacing, stemming length, hole length and powder factor, as well as back-break and fragmentation were collected at the Anguran mine in Iran. Root mean square error (RMSE) values equal to 2.76 and 0.53 for rock fragmentation and back-break, respectively, reveal the high reliability of the ANN model. In addition, ABC algorithm results suggest values of 29 cm and 3.25 m for fragmentation and back-break, respectively. For comparison purposes, an empirical model (Kuz-Ram) was performed to predict the mean fragment size in the Anguran mine. A mean fragment size of 33.5 cm shows the ABC algorithm can optimize rock fragmentation with a high degree of accuracy.","[Ebrahimi, Ebrahim; Monjezi, Masoud; Khalesi, Mohammad Reza] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Min, Fac Engn, Tehran 14115143, Iran; [Armaghani, Danial Jahed] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Geotech & Transportat, Fac Civil Engn, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia","Monjezi, M (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Min, Fac Engn, Tehran 14115143, Iran.",e.ebrahimi18@yahoo.com; monjezi@modares.ac.ir; mrkhalesi@modares.c.ir; danialarmaghani@yahoo.com,"Armaghani, Danial Jahed/U-3273-2019","Khalesi, Mohammad Reza/0000-0002-3851-8070",,,,39,72,73,2,86,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-9529,1435-9537,,B ENG GEOL ENVIRON,Bull.

To date, diverse soft computing, machine learning, and other techniques in terms of artificial intelligence have been utilized to satisfy the indexing requirements, yet in the literature, there is no reported state-of-the-art survey investigating the performance and consequences of techniques for solving indexing in big data issues as they enter cloud computing. The objective of this paper is to investigate and examine the existing indexing techniques for big data. Taxonomy of indexing techniques is developed to provide insight to enable researchers understand and select a technique as a basis to design an indexing mechanism with reduced time and space consumption for BD-MCC. In this study, 48 indexing techniques have been studied and compared based on 60 articles related to the topic. The indexing techniques' performance is analyzed based on their characteristics and big data indexing requirements. The main contribution of this study is taxonomy of categorized indexing techniques based on their method. The categories are non-artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence, and collaborative artificial intelligence indexing methods. In addition, the significance of different procedures and performance is analyzed, besides limitations of each technique. In conclusion, several key future research topics with potential to accelerate the progress and deployment of artificial intelligence-based cooperative indexing in BD-MCC are elaborated on.","[Gani, Abdullah; Siddiqa, Aisha; Shamshirband, Shahaboddin; Hanum, Fariza] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst & Informat Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Shamshirband, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst & Informat Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",shamshirband@um.edu.my,"Gani, Abdullah/C-2888-2009; nasaruddin, fariza h/B-8496-2010; Siddiqa, Aisha/J-2833-2015; S.Band, Shahab/ABI-7388-2020","Gani, Abdullah/0000-0002-4388-020X; nasaruddin, fariza h/0000-0003-2822-2214; Siddiqa, Aisha/0000-0002-1016-758X; Shamshirband, Shahaboddin/0000-0002-6605-498X",University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [P012C-13AFR]; Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education under the University of Malaya [M.C/625/1/HIR/MOE/FCSIT/03],"The authors would like to thank the University of Malaya for grant Big Data and Mobile Cloud For Collaborative Experiments, Project Number: P012C-13AFR and Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education under the University of Malaya High Impact Research Grant Mobile Cloud Computing: Device and Connectivity, Project Number: M.C/625/1/HIR/MOE/FCSIT/03.",,90,107,109,5,145,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0219-1377,0219-3116,,KNOWL INF SYST,Knowl.

Such changes have a large effect on hydrologic processes in the catchment area, which eventually results in an increase of both the magnitude and frequency of floods in urban areas. Therefore there is a great need of reliable rainfall-runoff models that are able to accurately estimate the discharge for a catchment. So far various physically-based models have been developed to capture the rainfall-runoff process, but the drawback has been the estimation the several numbers of parameters which is quite difficult and time consuming. Recently, artificial intelligence tools are being used because of their capability of modeling complex nonlinear relationships. These tools have been widely used in hydrological time series modeling and prediction. Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is a popular artificial intelligence technique that is well used in hydrological modeling. In this study, 30 extreme rainfall-runoff events were extracted from twelve years of hourly rainfall and runoff data. An input selection method based on correlation analysis and mutual information was developed to identify the proper input combinations of rainfall and discharge antecedents. The results obtained by RBFNN model were then compared with a traditionally used statistical model known as auto-regressive moving average with exogenous inputs (ARMAX), as a bench mark. Results showed that RBFNN performance is superior then the traditional statistical model and has good potential to be used as a reliable rainfall-runoff modeling tool.","[Nawaz, Nadeem; Harun, Sobri; Heryansyah, Arien] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Hydraul & Hydrol, Skudai 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia; [Othman, Rawshan] Erbil Polytech Univ, Koya Tech Inst, Petr Dept, Erbil 44001, Kurdistan Regio, Iraq; [Nawaz, Nadeem] Lasbela Univ Agr Water & Marine Sci, Fac Water Resources Management, Uthal 90150, Balochistan, Pakistan","Nawaz, N (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Hydraul & Hydrol, Skudai 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.; Nawaz, N (corresponding author), Lasbela Univ Agr Water & Marine Sci, Fac Water Resources Management, Uthal 90150, Balochistan, Pakistan.",nn.engr96@yahoo.com,"Ali, Rawshan/O-5258-2019; Nawaz, Nadeem/C-2750-2017; Nawaz, Nadeem/L-8835-2019; Othman, Rawshan/AAE-2463-2019; Heryansyah, Arien/Y-8219-2018","Ali, Rawshan/0000-0003-4903-7720; Nawaz, Nadeem/0000-0002-3821-2864; Nawaz, Nadeem/0000-0002-3821-2864; Heryansyah, Arien/0000-0001-6030-5613",,,,28,1,1,0,2,CHIANG MAI UNIV,CHIANG MAI,"FAC SCIENCE, 239 HUAY KAEW RD, T SUTHEP, CHIANG MAI, 50200, THAILAND",0125-2526,,,CHIANG MAI J SCI,Chiang Mai J.

As AFIB has the high potential to cause permanent disability in patients, its early detection is extremely important. There are different types of AFIB classification algorithm that have been proposed by researchers in recent years. Methods: This paper reviews the features of AFIB in terms of ECG morphological features and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis on different methods. The existing classification method, particularly focusing on Artificial Intelligence technique, is also comprehensively described. Other than that, the existing implementation technology of arrhythmia detection platforms such as smart phone and System-on-Chip-based embedded device are also elaborated in terms of their design trade-offs. Conclusion: Current existing AFIB detection algorithm cannot compromise for high accuracy and low complexity. Due to the limitation of embedded system, design trade off should be considered to strike the balance between the performance of algorithm and the limitation.","[Lim, Huey Woan; Hau, Yuan Wen] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Biosci & Med Engn, IJN UTM Cardiovasc Engn Ctr, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Lim, Chiao Wen] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Med, Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia; [Othman, Mohd Afzan] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Fac Elect Engn, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia","Hau, YW (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Biosci & Med Engn, IJN UTM Cardiovasc Engn Ctr, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",hauyuanwen@biomedical.utm.my,,/0000-0002-4929-3508,"Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) Trans-Disciplinary Research Grant Scheme (TRGS) [TRGS/1/2015/UTM/02/3/3, R.J130000.7845.4L842]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) Tier 1 Research University Grant [Q.J130000.2545.10H95]",This research is supported and funded by Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) Trans-Disciplinary Research Grant Scheme (TRGS) with Grant no.

While multi-hop CR network has drawn significant research interest in recent years, majority work has been validated through simulation. A key challenge in multi-hop CR network is to select a route with high quality of service (QoS) and lesser number of route breakages. In this paper, we propose three route selection schemes to enhance the network performance of CR networks, and investigate them using a real testbed environment, which consists of universal software radio peripheral and GNU radio units. Two schemes are based on reinforcement learning (RL), while a scheme is based on spectrum leasing (SL). RL is an artificial intelligence technique, whereas SL is a new paradigm that allows communication between licensed and unlicensed users in CR networks. We compare the route selection schemes with an existing route selection scheme in the literature, called highest-channel (HC), in a multi-hop CR network. With respect to the QoS parameters (i.e., throughput, packet delivery ratio, and the number of route breakages), the experimental results show that RL approaches achieve a better performance in comparison with the HC approach, and also achieve close to the performance achieved by the SL approach.","[Syed, Aqeel Raza; Yau, Kok-Lim Alvin] Sunway Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Selangor 46150, Malaysia; [Qadir, Junaid] Informat Technol Univ, Lahore 54000, Pakistan; [Mohamad, Hafizal; Ramli, Nordin] MEMOS Berhad, Wireless Network & Protocol Res Lab, Kuala Lumpur 57000, Malaysia; [Keoh, Sye Loong] Univ Glasgow Singapore, Sch Comp Sci, Singapore 737729, Singapore","Syed, AR (corresponding author), Sunway Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Selangor 46150, Malaysia.",12010591@imail.sunway.edu.my,"RAMLI, NORDIN/I-9524-2014; Keoh, Sye Loong/ABH-1430-2020; Qadir, Junaid/Q-6329-2019; Yau, Kok Lim Alvin/B-1672-2012","RAMLI, NORDIN/0000-0001-5358-284X; Keoh, Sye Loong/0000-0003-3640-5010; Qadir, Junaid/0000-0001-9466-2475; Yau, Kok Lim Alvin/0000-0003-3110-2782; Syed, Aqeel Raza/0000-0002-8817-9695","Malaysian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation under Science Fund [01-02-16-SF0027]; Malaysian Ministry of Education Fundamental Research [FRGS/1/2014/ICT03/SYUC/02/2]; Small Grant Scheme (Sunway-Lancaster) [SGSSL-FST-CSNS-0114-05, PVM1204]","This work was supported in part by the Malaysian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation under Science Fund under Grant 01-02-16-SF0027, in part by the Malaysian Ministry of Education Fundamental Research Grant Scheme under Grant FRGS/1/2014/ICT03/SYUC/02/2, and in part by the Small Grant Scheme (Sunway-Lancaster) under Grant SGSSL-FST-CSNS-0114-05 and Grant PVM1204.",,46,26,26,0,16,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2016,4,,,,,,6304,6324,,10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2613122,,,21,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,EC5SI,WOS:000388196100009,,DOAJ Gold,,,11/3/2021

Voltage stability indices (VSIs), called line stability index LQP, voltage collapse point indicators (VCPIs), and line stability factor L-mn have been employed to explore the most suitable location for UPFC. The locations of UPFC are identified by dynamically varying loads across all the PQ buses by different percentages to satisfy the real power system conditions. The simulations are conducted in a power system computer-aided design (PSCAD) environment where IEEE-39 bus system has been chosen as case study. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been ensured from the simulation results because UPFC's placement in the obtained locations resulted in an improved voltage stability condition. Furthermore, to verify the suitability of the explored locations, a comparative study has been conducted after placing UPFC in the present locations and other locations obtained using optimization techniques like particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), genetic algorithm (GA), and bacteria foraging algorithm (BFA). In all the cases, UPFC's placement in the identified locations using the proposed approach has resulted in better voltage stability condition improvement compared to heuristics approaches.","[Ahmad, Shameem; Albatsh, Fadi M.; Mekhilef, Saad] Univ Malaya, Dept Elect Engn, Power Elect & Renewable Energy Res Lab PEARL, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Ahmad, Shameem] Amer Int Univ Bangladesh, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Mokhlis, Hazlie] Univ Malaya, Dept Elect Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Ahmad, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Elect Engn, Power Elect & Renewable Energy Res Lab PEARL, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.; Ahmad, S (corresponding author), Amer Int Univ Bangladesh, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",ahmadshameem@siswa.um.edu.my,"Abu Bakar, Halim/B-8085-2010; Ahmad, Shameem/ABI-3356-2020; Albatsh, Fadi M./I-9249-2017; Mokhlis, Hazlie/B-8616-2010; Saad, Mekhilef/B-9652-2010","Albatsh, Fadi M./0000-0002-2999-9458; Mokhlis, Hazlie/0000-0002-1166-1934; Saad, Mekhilef/0000-0001-8544-8995","Ministry of Higher Education of MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia; University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [UM.C/HIR/MOHE/ENG/16001-00-D000017]; KETTHA Grant [53-02-03-1099]",The writers thank the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia and University of Malaya for providing financial support under research Grant No. UM.C/HIR/MOHE/ENG/16001-00-D000017 and KETTHA Grant No. 53-02-03-1099.,,39,1,1,0,7,AMER SOC TESTING MATERIALS,W CONSHOHOCKEN,"100 BARR HARBOR DR, W CONSHOHOCKEN, PA 19428-2959 USA",0090-3973,1945-7553,,J TEST EVAL,J.

Accordingly, the energy inputs and GHG emissions of orange production in north of Iran were modeled and optimized by artificial neural networks (ANN) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) in this study and the results obtained were compared with the results of data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach. Results showed that, on average, an amount of 25,582.50 MJ ha(-1) was consumed in orange orchards in the region and the nitrogen fertilizer was accounted for 36.84 % of the total input energy. The outcomes of this study demonstrated that on average 803 kg carbon dioxide (kgCO(2eq).) is emitted per ha and diesel fuel is responsible for 35.7 % of all emissions. The results of ANN signified that they were capable of modeling crop output and total GHG emissions where the model with a 13-4-2 topology had the highest accuracy in both training and testing steps. The optimization of energy consumption using MOGA revealed that the total energy consumption and GHG emissions of orange production can be reduced to the values of 13,519 MJ ha(-1) and 261 kgCO(2eq). ha(-1), respectively. A comparison between MOGA and DEA clearly showed the better performance of MOGA due to simultaneous application of different objectives and the global optimum solutions produced by the last generation.","[Nabavi-Pelesaraei, Ashkan; Rafiee, Shahin; Yousefinejad-Ostadkelayeh, Majid] Univ Tehran, Fac Agr Engn & Technol, Dept Agr Machinery Engn, Karaj, Iran; [Abdi, Reza] Univ Tabriz, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Machinery Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [Shamshirband, Shahaboddin] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst & Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Nabavi-Pelesaraei, A (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Fac Agr Engn & Technol, Dept Agr Machinery Engn, Karaj, Iran.; Shamshirband, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst & Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",ashkan.nabavi@yahoo.com; r.abdi@tabrizu.ac.ir; shahinrafiee@ut.ac.ir; shamshirband@um.edu.my; m_yousefinejad@ut.ac.ir,"S.Band, Shahab/ABI-7388-2020; Nabavi-Pelesaraei, Ashkan/AAO-7241-2020","Nabavi-Pelesaraei, Ashkan/0000-0003-2823-6616; Shamshirband, Shahaboddin/0000-0002-6605-498X","University of Tabriz, Iran","The financial support provided by the University of Tabriz, Iran, is duly acknowledged.",,44,21,21,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

The proposed method determines the peaks from the speech signal to form a voice contour. The area under the voice contour allows us to discriminate between normal and disordered subjects. In the case of disordered subjects, the calculated area under the voice contour is lower than that for a normal subject due to the malfunctioning of vocal folds, which makes the voice weaker and breathier. Some long-term features such as shimmer and jitter are based on the accurate estimation of fundamental frequency, which is itself a difficult task, especially for disordered speech signals. The proposed feature does not need to estimate the pitch period or fundamental frequency during the calculation of the voice contour and they provide a single value for the whole utterance similar to other long-term features. The voice disorder database used in this study includes 71 normal subjects and the same number of disordered subjects. Each disordered subject has one of the following voice disorders: vocal folds cysts, laryngopharyngeal reflux disease, vocal folds polyps, unilateral vocal folds paralysis and sulcus vocalic.

Backbreak is an unwanted phenomenon of blasting which can cause instability of mine walls, decreasing efficiency of drilling, falling down of machinery, etc. Recently, the use of new approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) is greatly recommended by many researchers. In this paper, a new AI technique namely genetic programing (GP) was developed to predict BB. To prepare a sufficient database, 175 blasting works were investigated in Sungun copper mine, Iran. In these operations, the most influential parameters on BB including burden, spacing, stemming length, powder factor and stiffness ratio were measured and used to develop BB predictive models. To demonstrate capability of GP technique, a non-linear multiple regression (NLMR) model was also employed for prediction of BB. Value account for (VAF), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) were used to control the capacity performance of the predictive models. The performance indices obtained by GP approach indicate the higher reliability of GP compared to NLMR model. RMSE and VAF values of 0.327 and 97.655, respectively, for testing datasets of GP approach reveal the superiority of this model in predicting BB, while these values were obtained as 0.865 and 81.816, respectively, for NLMR model.","[Faradonbeh, Roohollah Shirani; Monjezi, Masoud] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Min, Tehran 14115143, Iran; [Armaghani, Danial Jahed] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Geotech & Transportat, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia","Monjezi, M (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Min, Tehran 14115143, Iran.",roohollah.Shirani@modares.ac.ir; monjezi@modares.ac.ir; danialarmaghani@yahoo.com,"Faradonbeh, Roohollah Shirani/AAC-7175-2019; Armaghani, Danial Jahed/U-3273-2019; Shirani Faradonbeh, Roohollah/G-1715-2017","Faradonbeh, Roohollah Shirani/0000-0002-1518-3597; Shirani Faradonbeh, Roohollah/0000-0002-1518-3597",,,,41,53,53,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0177-0667,1435-5663,,ENG COMPUT-GERMANY,Eng.

However in the real world applications, this is often not the case. This paper addresses a significant note of inefficiency in methods for regression when dealing with outliers, especially for cases with polarity of noise involved (i.e., one sided noise with either only positive noise or negative noise). Using soft margin loss function concept, we propose Constrained Optimization method based Extreme Learning Machine for Regression, hereafter denoted as CO-ELM-R. The proposed method incorporates the two Lagrange multipliers that mimic Support Vector Regression (SVR) into the basis of ELM to cope with infeasible constraints of the regression optimization problem. Thus, CO-ELM-R will complement the recursive iterations of SVR in the training phase due to the fact that ELM is much simpler in structure and faster in implementation. The proposed CO-ELM-R is evaluated empirically on a few benchmark data sets and a real world application of NOx gas emission data set collected from one of the power plant in Malaysia. The obtained results have demonstrated its validity and efficacy in handling noisy data regression problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Rock fragmentation is affected by various parameters including blast pattern and rock characteristics, causing understanding the process difficult. As such, application of the robust techniques such as artificial intelligence can be utilized in this regard. In this paper, a predictive model was developed to predict rock fragmentation using fuzzy inference system (FIS) in Sarcheshmeh copper mine, Iran. For this purpose, blasting parameters including burden, spacing, hole diameter, Schmidt hammer rebound number, density of joint, powder factor, and stemming length were considered as model inputs to predict rock fragmentation (D80). In addition, by using the same data, a multiple equation was proposed with the help of multiple regression analysis (MRA). Results of coefficient of determination (R (2)) between predicted and measured rock fragmentation were computed as 0.922 and 0.738 for FIS and MRA models, respectively. Moreover, root mean square error (RMSE) and variance account for (VAF) FIS model were obtained as 2.423 and 92.195 %, respectively, while these values were achieved for MRA technique as 4.393 and 73.835 %, respectively. Comparison of the performance indices of the predictive models showed the superiority of the FIS model over the regression technique.

This approach is affected by the constraints of time and the availability of qualified personnel. Thus, new approaches to damage identification that provide faster and more accurate results are pursued. A promising approach to damage evaluation and detection utilizes artificial neural networks (ANNs) in solving these two problems. ANNs are a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) technique that have received wide acceptance in predicting the extent and location of damage in structures. In this study, the fundamental strategy for developing ANNs to predict the severity and location of double-point damage cases from the measured data of the dynamic behavior of the structure in I-beam structures is considered. ANNs are trained using vibration data consisting of natural frequencies and mode shapes obtained from experimental modal analysis and finite element simulations of intact and damaged I-beam structures. By using ANNs, some significant problems of conventional damage identification approaches can be overcome and damage detection accuracy can be improved. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Rice caters more than 30 % of the calorie requirement for the Asian countries. In Iran too rice is one of the most important agricultural products. Therefore, objective of this study was to develop a model based on artificial intelligence for predicting the output energy in rice production. Such a model could help farmers and policy makers. This model employed the polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) as the kernel function for support vector regression (SVR). The input energies from different sources used during rice production were given as the inputs to the model, and the output energy was chosen as the output of the model. In order to achieve generalized performance, SVRpoly and SVRrbf tried to minimize the generalization error bound, instead of minimizing the training error. The results show that the proposed model improves the predictive accuracy and capability of generalization.

This article proposes a SpectruM-Aware clusteR-based rouTing (SMART) scheme that enables SUs to form clusters in a cognitive radio network (CRN) and enables each SU source node to search for a route to its destination node on the clustered network. An intrinsic characteristic of CRNs is the dynamicity of operating environment in which network conditions (i.e., PUs' activities) change as time goes by. Based on the network conditions, SMART enables SUs to adjust the number of common channels in a cluster through cluster merging and splitting, and searches for a route on the clustered network using an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning. Simulation results show that SMART selects stable routes and significantly reduces interference to PUs, as well as routing overhead in terms of route discovery frequency, without significant degradation of throughput and end-to-end delay.

Its unique search process made it as one of the most competitive algorithm with some other search algorithms in the area of optimization, such as Genetic algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). However, the ABC performance of the local search process and the bee movement or the solution improvement equation still has some weaknesses. The ABC is good in avoiding trapping at the local optimum but it spends its time searching around unpromising random selected solutions. Inspired by the PSO, we propose a Hybrid Particle-movement ABC algorithm called HPABC, which adapts the particle movement process to improve the exploration of the original ABC algorithm. Numerical benchmark functions were used in order to experimentally test the HPABC algorithm. The results illustrate that the HPABC algorithm can outperform the ABC algorithm in most of the experiments (75% better in accuracy and over 3 times faster).","[Alqattan, Zakaria N.; Abdullah, Rosni] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia","Alqattan, ZN (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",zqttan2@yahoo.com; rosni@cs.usm.my,"Alqattan, Zakaria/L-5556-2019","Alqattan, Zakaria/0000-0002-2227-3793",Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) [203/PKOMP/6711268]; Universiti Sains Malaysia under Research University Cluster Grant Scheme (RUC) [1001/PKOMP/8630022],This research experiment has been funded by Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) for Bio-Inspired Optimization Method for Feature Selection of Mass Spectrometry Analysis in Biomarker Identification of Ovarian Cancer [203/PKOMP/6711268] and this research publication has been funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia under the Research University Cluster Grant Scheme (RUC) for Reconstruction of the Neural Microcircuitry or Reward-Controlled Learning in the Rat Hippocampus [1001/PKOMP/8630022].,,47,8,8,1,60,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0129-1831,1793-6586,,INT J MOD PHYS C,Int.

Hence, it is a major concern to predict and subsequently control the ground vibration due to blasting. This paper presents two artificial intelligence techniques, namely, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural network for the prediction of ground vibration in quarry blasting site. For this purpose, blasting parameters as well as ground vibrations of 109 blasting operations were measured in ISB granite quarry, Johor, Malaysia. Moreover, an empirical equation was also proposed based on the measured data. Several AI-based models were trained and tested using the measured data to determine the optimum models. Each model involved two inputs (maximum charge per delay and distance from the blast-face) and one output (ground vibration). To control capacity performances of the predictive models, the values of root mean squared error (RMSE), value account for (VAF), and coefficient of determination (R (2)) were computed for each model. It was found that the ANFIS model can provide better performance capacity in predicting ground vibration in comparison with other predictive techniques. The values of 0.973, 0.987 and 97.345 for R (2), RMSE and VAF, respectively, reveal that the ANFIS model is capable to predict ground vibration with high degree of accuracy.","[Armaghani, Danial Jahed; Momeni, Ehsan; Abad, Seyed Vahid Alavi Nezhad Khalil] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Geotech & Transportat, Fac Civil Engn, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Khandelwal, Manoj] Federat Univ Australia, Fac Sci & Technol, Ballarat, Vic 3353, Australia","Khandelwal, M (corresponding author), Federat Univ Australia, Fac Sci & Technol, POB 663, Ballarat, Vic 3353, Australia.",danialarmaghani@yahoo.com; mehsan23@live.utm.my; vankaseyed2@live.utm.my; m.khandelwal@federation.edu.au,"Khandelwal, Manoj/B-8219-2009; Armaghani, Danial Jahed/U-3273-2019; Momeni, Ehsan/K-4940-2013","Khandelwal, Manoj/0000-0003-0368-3188; Momeni, Ehsan/0000-0003-4084-485X",,,,72,69,70,1,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

They can be integrated into the computer system to make human-computer interaction (HCI) more effective. Affective computing is an innovative computational modeling and detecting user's emotions to optimize system responses in HCI. However, there is a trade-off between recognition accuracy and real-time performance in some of the methods such as processing the facial expressions, human voice and body gestures. Other methods lack efficiency and usability in real-world applications such as natural language processing and electroencephalography signals. To accomplish a reliable, usable and high-performance system, this paper proposes an intelligent hybrid approach to recognize users' emotions by using easily accessible and low computational cost input devices including keyboard, mouse (touch pad: single touch) and touch screen display (single touch). Using the proposed approach, the system is developed and trained in a supervised mode by artificial neural network and support vector machine (SVM) techniques. The result shows an increase in accuracy of 6 % (93.20 %) by SVM in comparison with the currently existing methods.

Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) has been widely used to predict the incipient fault in power transformers. However, sometimes the existing DGA methods yield inaccurate prediction of the incipient fault in transformer oil because each method is only suitable for certain conditions. Many previous works have reported on the use of intelligence methods to predict the transformer faults. However, it is believed that the accuracy of the previously proposed methods can still be improved. Since artificial neural network (ANN) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) techniques have never been used in the previously reported work, this work proposes a combination of ANN and various PSO techniques to predict the transformer incipient fault. The advantages of PSO are simplicity and easy implementation. The effectiveness of various PSO techniques in combination with ANN is validated by comparison with the results from the actual fault diagnosis, an existing diagnosis method and ANN alone. Comparison of the results from the proposed methods with the previously reported work was also performed to show the improvement of the proposed methods. It was found that the proposed ANN-Evolutionary PSO method yields the highest percentage of correct identification for transformer fault type than the existing diagnosis method and previously reported works.","[Illias, Hazlee Azil; Chai, Xin Rui; Mokhlis, Hazlie] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Abu Bakar, Ab Halim] Univ Malaya, Wisma R&D UM, UMPEDAC, Kuala Lumpur 59990, Malaysia","Illias, HA (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",h.illias@um.edu.my,"Mokhlis, Hazlie/B-8616-2010; Illias, Hazlee/K-2630-2015; Abu Bakar, Halim/B-8085-2010","Mokhlis, Hazlie/0000-0002-1166-1934; ","High Impact Research (HIR), Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education, HAI [H-16001-D00048]; Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education, HAI [FP026-2012A]","This work was supported by a High Impact Research (HIR) grant: H-16001-D00048, Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education, HAI.

Moreover, to the time series of groundwater levels, the time series of the five most effective parameters of groundwater level, that is rainfall, humidity, evaporation, minimum temperature and maximum temperature, were applied to obtain the best input parameters for the models. The performances of the different models were studied through evaluating the related values of the mean squared error and correlation coefficient to identify an optimal model that can simulate the decreasing trend of the groundwater level and provide passable simulation. In the model, excellent performance in different statistical indices was shown. Finally, a relatively good agreement between the calculated values and their corresponding measured values for the groundwater level were found. Evaluating the results of the various kinds of models, it has been shown that the obtained results of the ANFIS model are superior to those obtained from ANNs.","[Khaki, Mahmoud; Yusoff, Ismail; Islami, Nur] Univ Malaya, Dept Geol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Khaki, M (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Geol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",mahmoud.khaki@gmail.com,"YUSOFF, ISMAIL/B-8674-2010; Islami, Nur/AAB-7063-2021","YUSOFF, ISMAIL/0000-0001-9599-4359; Islami, Nur/0000-0003-2596-9320",University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [PV112-2012A],Authors would like to thank the Department of Mineral and Geosciences of Malaysia for their cooperation.

It is very trying for a new researcher to understand the whole concept of swarming robotics (SR) and optimization algorithm (i.e. realizing the idea from animal's perception to the SR application). In addition, the existing algorithms are computationally complicated, difficult to be understood by beginners as there are too many parameters. Thus, in this paper, we simplify the three branches of the main applications which are frequently used for SI namely: (1) optimization and networks design, (2) prediction and forecasting, and (3) SR.

Some approaches, such as OptKnock and OptGene, are developed to enhance the production of desired metabolites. However, the performances of these approaches are suboptimal and the obtained results are unsatisfactory because of computational limitations such as local minima. In this paper, we propose a hybrid of Bat Algorithm and Flux Balance Analysis (BATFBA) to enhance succinate and lactate production by identifying a set of genes for knock out. The Bat Algorithm is an optimisation algorithm, whereas Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is a mathematical approach to analyse the flow of metabolites through a metabolic network. The Escherichia coli iJR904 dataset was used to determine optimal knockout genes, production rate, and growth rate. By applying this hybrid method to the iJR904 dataset, we found that BATFBA yielded better results than existing methods, such as OptKnock and a hybrid of Artificial Bee Colony algorithms and Flux Balance Analysis (ABCFBA), at predicting succinate and lactate production.","[Chua, Pooi San; Salleh, Abdul Hakim Mohamed; Mohamad, Mohd Saberi; Deris, Safaai] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Comp, Artificial Intelligence & Bioinformat Res Grp, Skudai, Malaysia; [Omatu, Sigeru] Osaka Inst Technol, Dept Elect Informat & Commun Engn, Osaka 5358585, Japan; [Yoshioka, Michifumi] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Fac Engn, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan","Chua, PS (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Comp, Artificial Intelligence & Bioinformat Res Grp, Skudai, Malaysia.",saberi@utm.my,"Mohamad, Mohd Saberi/J-3201-2014","Mohamad, Mohd Saberi/0000-0002-1079-4559","Universiti Teknologi Malaysia [J130000.2507.05H50]; Ministry of Higher EducationScience and Technology Development Fund (STDF)Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR) [Q.J130000.3007.00M27]; Malaysian Ministry of Science, Technology and InnovationMinistry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia [06-01-06-SF1029, 01-01-06-SF1234]","We thank the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia for funding this research by the Research University Grant (GUP) (grant number: J130000.2507.05H50).

Diagnosis based on cultured specimens is the reference standard, however results take weeks to process. Scientists are looking for early detection strategies, which remain the cornerstone of tuberculosis control. Consequently there is a need to develop an expert system that helps medical professionals to accurately and quickly diagnose the disease. Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS) has been used successfully for diagnosing various diseases. However, little effort has been undertaken to improve its classification accuracy. Objectives: In order to increase the classification accuracy of AIRS, this study introduces a new hybrid system that incorporates a support vector machine into AIRS for diagnosing tuberculosis. Patients and Methods: Patient epacris reports obtained from the Pasteur laboratory of Iran were used as the benchmark data set, with the sample size of 175 (114 positive samples for TB and 60 samples in the negative group). The strategy of this study was to ensure representativeness, thus it was important to have an adequate number of instances for both TB and non-TB cases. The classification performance was measured through 10-fold cross-validation, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), sensitivity and specificity, Youden's Index, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Statistical analysis was done using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA), a machine learning program for windows. Results: With an accuracy of 100%, sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 100%, Youden's Index of 1, Area Under the Curve of 1, and RMSE of 0, the proposed method was able to successfully classify tuberculosis patients. Conclusions: There have been many researches that aimed at diagnosing tuberculosis faster and more accurately. Our results described a model for diagnosing tuberculosis with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This model can be used as an additional tool for experts in medicine to diagnose TBC more accurately and quickly.","[Saybani, Mahmoud Reza; Teh Ying Wah; Aghabozorgi, Saeed] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Kula Lumpur, Malaysia; [Shamshirband, Shahaboddin] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Chalous Branch, Chalous, Iran; [Hormozi, Shahram Golzari] Univ Hormozgan, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Bandar Abbas, Iran; [Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Gastroenterol & Liver Dis Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Olariu, Teodora] Vasile Goldis Western Univ Arad, Fac Med, Dept Intens Care, Arad, Romania","Saybani, MR (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Kula Lumpur, Malaysia.",saybani@gmail.com,"S.Band, Shahab/ABI-7388-2020; Teh, Ying Wah/ABD-6534-2020; Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin/I-5824-2019; Saybani, Mahmoud Reza/C-5668-2011; TEH, YING WAH/B-9938-2010","Teh, Ying Wah/0000-0002-3202-7035; Saybani, Mahmoud Reza/0000-0001-7643-1091; TEH, YING WAH/0000-0002-3202-7035; Shamshirband, Shahaboddin/0000-0002-6605-498X",,,,43,10,10,0,13,KOWSAR PUBL,HOENSBROEK,"PATERSWEG 22,, HOENSBROEK, LIMBURG 6431 GC, NETHERLANDS",2074-1804,2074-1812,,IRAN RED CRESCENT ME,Iran.

This paper proposes a new algorithm, namely Enhanced compact Artificial Bee Colony (EcABC) to address this class of optimization problems. The algorithm benefits from the search logic of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, and similar to other compact algorithms, it does not store the actual population of tentative solutions. Instead, EcABC employs a novel probabilistic representation of the population that is introduced in this paper. The proposed algorithm has been tested on a set of benchmark functions from the CEC2013 benchmark suite, and compared against a number of algorithms including modern compact algorithms, recent population-based ABC variants and some advanced meta-heuristics. Numerical results demonstrate that EcABC significantly outperforms other state of the art compact algorithms. In addition, simulations also indicate that the proposed algorithm shows a comparative performance when compared against its population-based versions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Fuzzy logic (FL) as a well-known AI technique is effectively used in modeling of machining processes such as to predict the surface roughness and to control the cutting force in various machining processes. This paper is started with the introduction to definition of FL and machining process, and their relation. This paper then presents five types of analysis conducted on FL techniques used in machining process. FL was considered for prediction, selection, monitoring, control and optimization of machining process. Literature showed that milling contributed the highest number of machining operation that was modeled using FL. In terms of machining performance, surface roughness was mostly studied with FL model. In terms of fuzzy components, center of gravity method was mostly used to perform defuzzification, and triangular was mostly considered to perform membership function. The reviews extend the analysis on the abilities, limitations and effectual modifications of FL in modeling based on the comments from previous works that conduct experiment using FL in the modeling and review by few authors. The analysis leads the author to conclude that FL is the most popular AI techniques used in modeling of machining process.","[Adnan, M. R. H.

The Pareto-ANOVA optimization method was used to obtain the optimum parameter conditions for the machining process. Experiments were carried out using oblique dry CNC turning. The machining parameters of cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut were optimized according to surface roughness values. The results indicated that a cutting speed of 250 m/min, a feed rate of 0.05 mm/rev, and a depth of cut of 0.15 mm were the optimum CNC dry turning conditions. The results also indicated that Sr and Sb had a negative effect on workpiece machinability. The workpiece containing Bi exhibited the lowest surface roughness value, likely due to the formation of pure Bi that acted as lubricant during turning. A confirmation experiment was performed to check the validity of the model developed in this paper, and the predicted surface roughness came had an error rate of only 5.4%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Researchers have proposed a bee colony optimization (BCO) algorithm as part of swarm intelligence. BCO is a meta-heuristic algorithm based on the foraging behavior of bees. This study presents a hybrid BCO algorithm for examination timetabling problems. Bees in the BCO algorithm perform two main actions: forward pass and backward pass. Each bee explores the search space in forward pass and then shares information with other bees in the hive in backward pass. This study found that a bee decides to be either a recruiter that searches for a food source or a follower that selects a recruiter bee to follow on the basis of roulette wheel selection. In forward pass, BCO is supported along with other local searches, including the Late Acceptance Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing algorithms. We introduce three selection strategies (tournament, rank and disruptive selection strategies) for the follower bees to select a recruiter to maintain population diversity in backward pass. The disruptive selection strategy outperforms tournament and rank selections. We also introduce a self-adaptive mechanism to select a neighborhood structure to enhance the neighborhood search. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against the latest methodologies in the literature with respect to two standard examination timetabling problems, namely, uncapacitated and competition datasets. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces one new best result on uncapacitated datasets and comparable results on competition datasets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to investigate the expected functionality of the required standard, the prediction of the effluent quality, namely biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand and total suspended solid of an SSTP was modelled using an artificial intelligence approach. In this paper, we adopt the clonal selection algorithm (CSA) to set up a prediction model, with a well-established method - namely the least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) as a baseline model. The test results of the case study showed that the prediction of the CSA-based SSTP model worked well and provided model performance as satisfactory as the LS-SVM model. The CSA approach shows that fewer control and training parameters are required for model simulation as compared with the LS-SVM approach. The ability of a CSA approach in resolving limited data samples, nonlinear sample function and multidimensional pattern recognition makes it a powerful tool in modelling the prediction of effluent removals in an SSTP.","[Chun, Ting Sie] Univ Tenaga Nas, Dept Civil Engn, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Malek, M.

However, tf-idf does not consider the metadata, such as the time frame at which a term was used, when calculating the weight of the terms. This study proposes an alternate term-weighting technique to improve the accuracy of automatic bug assignment approaches that use a term-weighting technique. This technique includes the use of metadata in addition to the statistical computation to calculate the term weights. Moreover, it restricts the set of terms used to only nouns.

The purpose is benefitting from the synergies obtained from combining these technologies for the development of classification models. Such a combination creates an opportunity to invest in the strength of each algorithm, and is an approach to make up for their deficiencies. To develop proposed model, with the aim of obtaining the best array of features, first, feature ranking techniques such as the Fisher's discriminant ratio and class separability criteria were used to prioritize features. Second, the obtained results that included arrays of the top-ranked features were used as the initial population of a genetic algorithm to produce optimum arrays of features. Third, using a modified k-Nearest Neighbor method as well as an improved method of backpropagation neural networks, the classification process was advanced based on optimum arrays of the features selected by genetic algorithms. The performance of the proposed model was compared with thirteen well-known classification models based on seven datasets. Furthermore, the statistical analysis was performed using the Friedman test followed by post-hoc tests. The experimental findings indicated that the novel proposed hybrid model resulted in significantly better classification performance compared with all 13 classification methods. Finally, the performance results of the proposed model was benchmarked against the best ones reported as the state-of-the-art classifiers in terms of classification accuracy for the same data sets. The substantial findings of the comprehensive comparative study revealed that performance of the proposed model in terms of classification accuracy is desirable, promising, and competitive to the existing state-of-the-art classification models.","[Salari, Nader; Shohaimi, Shamarina; Nallappan, Meenakshii] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Salari, Nader; Najafi, Farid] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Kermanshah, Iran; [Karishnarajah, Isthrinayagy] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia","Salari, N (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",nader.salari.1344@gmail.com,"Salari, Nader/AAN-4849-2020; Salari, Nader/U-7761-2017; Najafi, Farid/I-3830-2015; Shohaimi, Shamarina/AAL-2810-2020","Salari, Nader/0000-0003-3550-405X; Najafi, Farid/0000-0002-0534-6444; Shohaimi, Shamarina/0000-0003-0591-6627; Nallappan, Meenakshii/0000-0002-0953-2295; Salari, Nader/0000-0002-6448-5313",,,,64,15,15,0,14,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,Nov-24,2014,9,11,,,,,,,e112987,10.1371/journal.pone.0112987,,,50,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AX2IM,WOS:000346766900015,25419659,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,11/3/2021

Sustainable energy is important for the benefits it yields. Sustainable energy technologies are clean sources of energy that have a much lower environmental impact than conventional energy technologies. Among the different forms of clean energy, solar energy has attracted a lot of attentibn as it is not only sustainable, but is also renewable. Because the number of meteorological stations where global solar radiation (GSR) is recorded is limited in Iran, the aim was to develop three distinctive models in order to prognosticate GSR in Tehran Province, Iran. Accordingly, the fuzzy linear regression (FLR), polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) were applied as the kernel function of support vector regression (SVR). Input energies from different meteorological data obtained from the only station in the study region were selected as the model inputs while GSR was chosen as the model output. Instead of minimizing the observed training error, SVR_poly and SVR_rbf attempted to minimize the generalization error bounds so as to achieve generalized performance. The experimental results show that it is possible to achieve enhanced predictive accuracy and capability of generalization via the proposed approach. The calculated root mean square error and correlation coefficient disclosed that SVR rbf performed well in predicting GSR compared with FLR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This parameter cannot be simply predicted since there are nonlinear and unknown relationships between permeability and other reservoir properties. To obtain information about permeability, core samples are analyzed or well tests are performed conventionally. These are, however, very expensive and time-consuming to perform. Well log data is another source of information which is always available and much cheaper than core sample and well testing analysis. Thus establishing a relationship between reservoir permeability and well log data can be very helpful in estimation of this vital parameter. However, establishing relationship between well logs and permeability is not a simple task and cannot be done using a simple linear or nonlinear method. Relevance Vector Regression (RVR) is one of the robust artificial intelligence algorithms proved to be very successful in recognition of relationships between input and output parameters. The aim of this paper is to show the application of RVR in prediction of permeability in three wells located in a carbonate reservoir in the south part of Iran. To do this, genetic algorithm (GA) was used as an optimizer to find the best logs for prediction of permeability. Comparing the results of RVR with that of a Support Vector Regression (SVR) indicated more accuracy of RVR in prediction of permeability. However, SVR can still be considered as a second option for prediction of petrophysical properties due to its reliable efficiency. However, it should be noticed that all of the predictions using well logs data are limited to the intervals where logs are available. Thus more studies are still required to propose alternative methods whose results can be used for the entire reservoir. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This algorithm has been successfully used as an optimization tool in combinatorial and functional optimization fields. In addition, its behavior very closely mimics the actual behavior that occurs in nature, and it is very simple and easy to implement. However, its convergence speed to the optimal solution still needs further improvement and it also needs a mechanism to obviate getting trapped in local optima. In this paper, a novel initialization algorithm based on the patch concept and Levy flight distribution is proposed to initialize the population of bees in BA. Consequently, we incorporate this initialization procedure into a proposed enhanced BA variant. The proposed variant is more natural than conventional variants of BA. It mimics the patch environment in nature and Levy flight, which is believed to characterize the foraging patterns of bees in nature. The results of experiments conducted on several widely used high-dimensional benchmarks indicate that our proposed enhanced BA variant significantly outperforms other BA variants and state-of-the-art variants of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, and success rate. In addition, the results of experimental analyses conducted indicate that our proposed enhanced BA is very stable, has the ability to deal with differences in search ranges, and rapidly converges without getting stuck in local optima.

This problem has been tackled using metaheuristics techniques. Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has been successfully used for tackling uncapaciated examination and course timetabling problems. In this paper, a novel hybrid ABC algorithm based on the integrated technique is proposed for tackling the university course timetabling problem. First of all, initial feasible solutions are generated using the combination of saturation degree (SD) and backtracking algorithm (BA). Secondly, a hill climbing optimizer is embedded within the employed bee operator to enhance the local exploitation ability of the original ABC algorithm while tackling the problem. Hill climbing iteratively navigates the search space of each population member in order to reach a local optima. The proposed hybrid ABC technique is evaluated using the dataset established by Socha including five small, five medium and one large problem instances. Empirical results on these problem instances validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Our work also shows that a well-designed hybrid technique is a competitive alternative for addressing the university course timetabling problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

One of the most prevalent techniques is the use of smart pigs to travel along the pipeline and detect defects using various types of sensors such as magnetic sensors and eddy-current sensors. A critical short coming of smart pigs is the inability to monitor continuously and predict the onset of defects. The emergence of permanently installed long range ultrasonics transducers systems enable continuous monitoring to be achieved. The needs for and the challenges of the proposed technique are presented.

Wiper system is a high order, nonlinear model with single-input and multi-outputs so that rise time, maximum overshoot, and end-point vibration of wiper blade are observed in conflict as the faster response leads to the larger level of undesired noise and vibration. The first part of this paper centers acquiring experimental data from a passenger automobile wiper system during its operation and using a reliable nonlinear system identification, namely, nonlinear autoregressive exogenous Elman neural network. Knowing that in a practical environment, where the loading conditions of the flexible wiper blade may be varied due to rain, snow, or wind lift in high-speed driving, causing changes in the characteristics of the system, the system performance with a fixed conventional controller scheme will not be satisfactory. The main contribution of this work is presented in second part where a novel multiobjective, bilevel adaptive-fuzzy controller is proposed for an automobile wiper system. The system's parameters are tuned simultaneously by a multiobjective genetic algorithm based on fitness sharing whereby an automobile wiper blade is moved within its sweep workspace in the least amount of time with minimum noise and vibration.","[Zolfagharian, Ali; Zain, Mohd Zarhamdy Md] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Syst Dynam & Control, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Noshadi, Amin] Victoria Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, Fac Hlth Engn & Sci, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Ghasemi, Seyed Ebrahim] Babol Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Babol Sar, Iran","Zolfagharian, A (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Syst Dynam & Control, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia.",zolfagharian.ali.utm@gmail.com,"Zolfagharian, Ali/J-5167-2019","Zolfagharian, Ali/0000-0001-5302-360X",,,,44,11,11,0,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0954-4062,2041-2983,,P I MECH ENG C-J MEC,Proc.

The novel controller scheme contains several feedback loops instead of only a feed-forward loop as in the conventional recurrent neural network (RNN). In the proposed controller model, the RNN identifier creates a sample of the connected system and its output generates a part of inputs for the RNN controller which then sends the control signal to the SVC system. Three types of non-linear conditions are chosen to test the operational capability of the new control system to perform the voltage regulation satisfying the IEEE Std 519-1992. The test cases contain a three-phase fault power system, opening of one of the transmission lines in a double line transmission system and sudden changes in the load demand. Results show that the proposed control model is capable of regulating the voltage of the system in a desired range.","[Rahmani, R.; Othman, M. F.; Shojaei, A.

A comparison has been made between evolutionary methods [genetic algorithm (GA)] and swarm intelligences [particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization] in searching the optimum reservoir release policy. From the historical recorded data, the monthly inflow was categorized into three states: high, medium and low. As a guideline for the decision maker, an optimum release curve was generated for each month showing the release options with a variety of different storage conditions. GA (real and binary), ABC optimization and PSO algorithm have been used as optimization tools with the same formulation and objective function for all the methods. For verification of the models, a simulation is done by using 264 monthly historical inflow data. Different indices such as reliability, vulnerability and resiliency were calculated in order to check the performance and risk analysis purposes. The results show that the most recently developed ABC optimization technique provides the best results in meeting demands, avoiding wastage of water and in handling critical period of low flows.","[Hossain, M.

CBR has been applied in many areas in the commercial sector to assist daily operations. However, CBR is relatively new in the field of forensic science. Even though forensic personnel have consciously used past experiences in solving new cases, the idea of applying machine intelligence to support decision-making in forensics is still in its infancy and poses a great challenge. This paper highlights the limitation of the methods used in forensics compared with a CBR method in the analysis of forensic evidences. The design and development of an Intelligent Forensic Autopsy Report System (I-AuReSys) basing on a CBR method along with the experimental results are presented. Our system is able to extract features by using an information extraction (IE) technique from the existing autopsy reports; then the system analyzes the case similarities by coupling the CBR technique with a Naive Bayes learner for feature-weights learning; and finally it produces an outcome recommendation. Our experimental results reveal that the CBR method with the implementation of a learner is indeed a viable alternative method to the forensic methods with practical advantages.

The test results showed that the combined fuzzy logic and SLP network methodology contributed to a 100% classification accuracy of the network. The high-classification accuracy significantly demonstrates the suitability of the proposed features and classification using SLP networks for classifying the reflected signals from teeth surfaces, enabling the sensor to accurately measure small diameters of tooth cavity of up to 0.6 mm.

Wiper system is a flexible structure with high order, nonlinear model that is considered as a multi objective control problem since there is a conflict between its functionality quality in wiping and generated unwanted noise and vibration. A passive control technique using multi body system (MBS) model and finite element analysis (FEA) is introduced to identify the potential of the effectiveness of the physical parameters of wiper blade to give appropriate range to reduce the unwanted noise and vibration in the system. While, the significant contribution of active controller is to deal with uncertainties exerted to system within wiper operation. In passive control stage, natural frequencies of a uniblade automobile wiper are determined using modal testing. Later, a 3-dimensional model of a wiper blade assembly is developed in multi body system design to investigate the good validation test and agreement of the physical behavior of the system in experiment with finite element analysis. Parametric modification via complex eigenvalue is adopted to predict instability of the wiper blade. In active control level, experimental data collected from the wiper system during its operation. A system identification model named nonlinear auto regressive exogenous Elman neural network (NARXENN) is developed for implying the active controller. A bi-level adaptive-fuzzy controller is brought in whose parameters are tuned simultaneously by a multi objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) to deal with the conflict interests in wiper control problem.

Sub-band power ratios are calculated from energy spectral density of theta, alpha and beta frequency bands. Synthetic data have been generated to increase dataset from 50 to 120. The features are used as input to the artificial neural network. Subsequently, the brain behaviour model has been developed using an artificial neural network that is trained with optimized learning rate, momentum constant and hidden nodes.

In addition, ETo is vital for calculating the agricultural demand. In fact, Penman-Monteith (PM) method is considered as reference method for estimating (ETo), however, this method required a lot of data to be used which is not usually available in many catchment areas. Furthermore, there are several efforts that have been performed as competitor to reach accurate estimation of (ETo) when there is lack of data to utilize (PM) method, but still required numerous research. Recently, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been suggested to provide reliable prediction model for several application in engineering and especially for hydrological process. However, time series prediction based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learning algorithms is fundamentally difficult and faces problem. One of the major shortcomings is that the ANN model experiences over-fitting problem during training session and also occurs when a neural network loses its generalization. In this research a modification for the classical Multi Layer Preceptron- Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN) modeling namely; Ensemble Neural Network (ENN) is proposed and applied for predicting daily ETo.

It has a negative and lasting effect on children who use the Internet; thus, pornography has become a serious threat not only to Internet users but also to society at large. Therefore, developing efficient and reliable tools to automatically filter pornographic contents is imperative. However, the effective interception of pornography remains a challenging issue. In this paper, a four-phase anti-pornography system based on the neural and Bayesian methods of artificial intelligence is proposed. Primitive information on pornography is examined and then used to determine if a given image falls under the pornography category. First, we present a detailed description of preliminary study phase followed by the modeling phase for the proposed skin detector. An anti-pornography system is created in the development phase, which also includes the proposed pornography classifier based on skin detection. Finally, the performance assessment method for the proposed anti-pornography system is discussed in the evaluation phase.","[Zaidan, A. A.; Karim, H. Abdul; Ahmad, N. N.; Zaidan, B.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an artificial intelligence approach that enables a node to observe, learn, and make appropriate decisions on action selection in order to maximize network performance. Routing enables a source node to search for a least-cost route to its destination node. While there have been increasing efforts to enhance the traditional RL approach for routing in wireless networks, this research area remains largely unexplored in the domain of routing in CR networks. This paper applies RL in routing and investigates the effects of various features of RL (i.e., reward function, exploitation, and exploration, as well as learning rate) through simulation. New approaches and recommendations are proposed to enhance the features in order to improve the network performance brought about by RL to routing. Simulation results show that the RL parameters of the reward function, exploitation, and exploration, as well as learning rate, must be well regulated, and the new approaches proposed in this paper improves SUs' network performance without significantly jeopardizing PUs' network performance, specifically SUs' interference to PUs.","[Al-Rawi, Hasan A.

However, weights computed by LCMV usually are not able to form the radiation beam towards the target user precisely and not good enough to reduce the interference by placing null at the interference sources. It is difficult to improve and optimize the LCMV beamforming technique through conventional empirical approach. To provide a solution to this problem, artificial intelligence (AI) technique is explored in order to enhance the LCMV beamforming ability. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO), dynamic mutated artificial immune system (DM-AIS), and gravitational search algorithm (GSA) are incorporated into the existing LCMV technique in order to improve the weights of LCMV. The simulation result demonstrates that received signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) of target user can be significantly improved by the integration of PSO, DM-AIS, and GSA in LCMV through the suppression of interference in undesired direction. Furthermore, the proposed GSA can be applied as a more effective technique in LCMV beamforming optimization as compared to the PSO technique.

Findings - The sensor-elements for the tactile sensing structure were made by press-curing from carbon-black-filled silicone rubber. The experimental results can be used as training and checking data for the ANFIS network. Originality/value - This system is capable to find any change of contact positions and thus indicates state of the current contact location of the tactile sensing structure.

Motor circuit parameters are essential for designing, evaluating performance, and controlling the applications of the motor. However, it is difficult to measure the electric parameters, e.g., resistance and reactance, of induction motors accurately. Therefore, researchers have noted the parameter estimation of induction motors as an essential optimization problem. The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is an efficient element of bioinspired optimization algorithms and has been successfully applied in numerous engineering applications. However, the ABC algorithm suffers from slow convergence and poor exploitation. Additionally, there are bleak chances of getting a fitter food source for scout bees using the the standard ABC algorithm scheme. Therefore, different solutions have already been proposed to avoid the flaws of the ABC algorithm. Nevertheless, the proposed solutions are either computationally intensive or prone to local optima traps or they require additional control variables to tune. Moreover, there is no systematic way to tune the additional control variables for yielding the optimal performance of the algorithms. Therefore, this research work proposes a novel variant of the ABC algorithm, which capitalizes on multiple global-best food sources rather than a single global-best food source. In addition, this research work proposes a novel scheme for enhancing the performance of the ABC algorithm's scout bee. Two modifications for the performance enhancement of the ABC algorithm are proposed in this research work. The proposed algorithm is compared with various recently proposed variants of the ABC algorithm and various other available methods for estimating induction motor parameters. The performance of the proposed algorithm is also assessed using the chaotic map initialization technique. The results prove that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve the best convergence among all of the compared algorithms.","[Abro, Abdul Ghani; Mohamad-Saleh, Junita] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia","Mohamad-Saleh, J (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Engn Campus, Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia.",ms@eng.usm.my,"Mohamad-Saleh, Junita/D-2724-2019","Mohamad-Saleh, Junita/0000-0003-3447-6050",IPS-Universiti-Sains Malaysia (USM); Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education [203/PELECT/6071247],The authors acknowledge the fellowship scheme of IPS-Universiti-Sains Malaysia (USM) and Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) from the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education No: 203/PELECT/6071247 for the financial support.,,30,11,12,0,22,TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY,ANKARA,"ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY",1300-0632,1303-6203,,TURK J ELECTR ENG CO,Turk.

The learning process, a very important feature of intelligent methods, is the result of an intelligent game controller to determine and control the game objects behaviors' or actions autonomously. Our approach is to use a more efficient learning model in the form of artificial neural networks for training the controllers. We propose a Hill-Climbing Neural Network (HillClimbNet) that controls the movement of the Ms. Pac-man agent to travel around the maze, gobble all of the pills and escape from the ghosts in the maze. HillClimbNet combines the hill-climbing strategy with a simple, feed-forward artificial neural network architecture. The aim of this study is to analyze the performance of various activation functions for the purpose of generating neural-based controllers to play a video game. Each non-linear activation function is applied identically for all the nodes in the network, namely log-sigmoid, logarithmic, hyperbolic tangent-sigmoid and Gaussian. In general, the results shows an optimum configuration is achieved by using log-sigmoid, while Gaussian is the worst activation function.","[Tan, Tse Guan; Teo, Jason] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Sch Engn & Informat Technol, Evolutionary Comp Lab, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia; [Anthony, Patricia] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Ctr Excellence Semant Agents, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia","Tan, TG (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Sabah, Sch Engn & Informat Technol, Evolutionary Comp Lab, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia.",tseguantan@gmail.com,"Teo, Jason/E-2690-2016; Anthony, Patricia/R-6450-2018","Teo, Jason/0000-0003-2415-5915; Anthony, Patricia/0000-0002-4991-3340","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, MalaysiaMinistry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia [SCF52-ICT-3/2008]","This research is funded under the Science Fund project SCF52-ICT-3/2008 granted by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Malaysia.",,14,4,4,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-2821,1573-7462,,ARTIF INTELL REV,Artif.

Results indicated high simulation performance, with the correlation coefficient and the mean average percentage error of the best model reaching 0.996 and 7 %, respectively. The variables that strongly influenced groundwater nitrate concentration were previous nitrate concentration, groundwater recharge, and on-ground nitrogen load of each land use land cover category in the well's vicinity. The results also demonstrated the merit of performing clustering of input data prior to the application of AI models.

The artificial neurofuzzy interface system (ANFIS) is one of the most accurate models used in water resource management. Because the membership functions (MFs) possess the characteristics of smoothness and mathematical components, each set of input data is able to yield the best result using a certain type of MF in the ANFIS models.

The topic of tool life prediction has been an interesting and important research topic attracting the attention of a wide number of researchers in this particular area. In terms of the suitable methods used in this research topic, it is stated that both statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches can be employed to model tool life. For further justifying the capability of the ANN model in predicting tool life, the current study was based on conducting experimental work for collecting the experimental data. After carrying out the experiment, 17 data sets were collected and they were divided into two subsets; the first one for training and the second for testing. Since the data sets seemed to be lower than the number of data sets used in previous studies, we attempted to make verification of the ability of the ANN model in learning and adapting with low training and testing data. Diverse topologies accompanied with single and two hidden layers were created for modeling the tool life. For choosing the best and most effective network, the study adopted the mean square error function as criteria for the evaluation of the network selection. Thus, based on the data generated from the same experiment, a regression model (RM) was constructed employing the SPSS software. A comparison between the ANN model and RMs in terms of their accuracy was carried out and the findings revealed that the accuracy of the ANN was higher than that of the RM.","[Al-Zubaidi, Salah; Ghani, Jaharah A.; Haron, Che Hassan Che] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia","Al-Zubaidi, S (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",salah@eng.ukm.my,"haron, che hassan c/E-8357-2018; Al-Zubaidi, Salah/AAR-7139-2020; Ghani, Jaharah A./AAH-5184-2019","haron, che hassan c/0000-0002-4062-7831; Al-Zubaidi, Salah/0000-0002-0308-548X; ",,,,11,3,3,0,5,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,SELANGOR,"FACULTY SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, BANGI, SELANGOR, 43600, MALAYSIA",0126-6039,,,SAINS MALAYS,Sains Malays.,DEC,2013,42,12,,,,,1735,1741,,,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,260HR,WOS:000327586100007,,,,,11/3/2021

However, each of them has its limitations depending on different conditions such as data size and dimensionality. Hybrid computational intelligence has been introduced as a new paradigm to complement the weaknesses of one technique with the strengths of another or others. This paper presents a computational intelligence hybrid model to overcome some of the limitations of the standalone type-2 fuzzy logic system (T2FLS) model by using a least-square-fitting-based model selection algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the input data while selecting the best variables. This novel feature selection procedure resulted in the improvement of the performance of T2FLS whose complexity is usually increased and performance degraded with increased dimensionality of input data. The iterative least-square-fitting algorithm part of functional networks (FN) and T2FLS techniques were combined in a hybrid manner to predict the porosity and permeability of North American and Middle Eastern oil and gas reservoirs. Training and testing the T2FLS block of the hybrid model with the best and dimensionally reduced input variables caused the hybrid model to perform better with higher correlation coefficients, lower root mean square errors, and less execution times than the standalone T2FLS model. This work has demonstrated the promising capability of hybrid modelling and has given more insight into the possibility of more robust hybrid models with better functionality and capability indices.","[Anifowose, Fatai; Labadin, Jane] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Kota Samarahan 94300, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Abdulraheem, Abdulazeez] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Petr Engn, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia","Anifowose, F (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Kota Samarahan 94300, Sarawak, Malaysia.",fanifowose@gmail.com,"Labadin, Jane/ABA-1014-2020; Anifowose, Fatai/C-1362-2015","Labadin, Jane/0000-0003-0508-4277; Anifowose, Fatai/0000-0002-1823-8338","King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) through the Science & Technology Unit at King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM) as part of the National Science, Technology and Innovation Plan [08-OIL82-4]","The authors would like to thank the Universiti Malaysia Sarawak and King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals for providing the resources used in the conduct of this study.

To address this issue, reliable techniques are required to provide fast and accurate load shedding to prevent collapse in the power system. Computational intelligence techniques, due to their robustness and flexibility in dealing with complex non-linear systems, could be an option in addressing this problem. Computational intelligence includes techniques like artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic control, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, and particle swarm optimization. Research in these techniques is being undertaken in order to discover means for more efficient and reliable load shedding. This paper provides an overview of these techniques as applied to load shedding in a power system. This paper also compares the advantages of computational intelligence techniques over conventional load shedding techniques. Finally, this paper discusses the limitation of computational intelligence techniques, which restricts their usage in load shedding in real time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the experimental measurements of the electrical conductivity of two classes of DESs based on ammonium and phosphonium salts at different compositions and temperatures were reported. The results revealed that electrical conductivity of DESs has temperature-dependency. In addition, molar conductivities of ammonium and phosphonium salts in DESs were obtained using DESs experimental values of electrical conductivities. The feasibility of using an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the electrical conductivity of ammonium and phosphonium based DESs at different temperatures and compositions was also examined. A feed-forward back propagation neural network with 8 hidden neurons was successfully developed and trained with the measured electrical conductivity data. The results indicated that among the different networks tested, the network with 8 hidden neurons had the best prediction performance and gave the smallest value of Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) (0.0010) and acceptable values of Index of Agreement (IA) (0.9999) and Regression Coefficient (R-2) (0.9988). The comparison of the predicted electrical conductivity of DESs by the proposed model with those obtained by experiments confirmed the reliability of the ANN model with an average absolute relative deviation (AARD%) of 4.40%.

Among the most significant research difficulties in such networks safety is intrusion detection, whose target is to distinguish between misuse and abnormal behavior so as to ensure secure, reliable network operations and services. Intrusion detection is best delivered by multi-agent system technologies and advanced computing techniques. To date, diverse soft computing and machine learning techniques in terms of computational intelligence have been utilized to create Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS), yet the literature does not report any state-of-the-art reviews investigating the performance and consequences of such techniques solving wireless environment intrusion recognition issues as they gain entry into cloud computing. The principal contribution of this paper is a review and categorization of existing IDPS schemes in terms of traditional artificial computational intelligence with a multi-agent support. The significance of the techniques and methodologies and their performance and limitations are additionally analyzed in this study, and the limitations are addressed as challenges to obtain a set of requirements for IDPS in establishing a collaborative-based wireless IDPS (Co-WIDPS) architectural design.

Artificial intelligence-based methods may provide reliable prediction models for several applications in engineering. However, time-series prediction based on artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithms is fundamentally problematic. For example, the ANN model can experience over-fitting during training and, in consequence, lose its generalization. In this research, several over-fitting procedures have been augmented with the classical ANN model, are proposed. This model was applied to the prediction of the daily ETo at Rasht city, located in the north part of Iran, by using the minimum and maximum daily temperature of the region collected from 1975-1988. In addition, three different scenarios have been developed in order to achieve better prediction accuracy. The results showed that the proposed ENN model successfully predicted the daily ETo with a significant level of accuracy using only the maximum and minimum temperatures. The model also outperformed the classical ANN method. In addition, the proposed ENN compared with Hargreaves and Samani (Appl Eng Agric 1:96-99, 1985) (HGS) model and showed the ENN provides more accurate prediction for ETo. Furthermore, the proposed model could provide relatively good level of accuracy when examined for multi-lead predictions, which could not be afford by HGS model.","[El-Shafie, Ahmed; Alsulami, Humod Mosad; Najah, Ali] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Alsulami, Humod Mosad] Kingdom Saudi Arabia, Minist Higher Educ, Riyadh 11153, Saudi Arabia; [Jahanbani, Heerbod] Univ Melbourne, Fac Engn, Infrastruct Dept, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia","El-Shafie, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",elshafie@eng.ukm.my,"El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014","El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505","Smart Engineering System, and Water and Environmental Research Group, University Kebangsaan Malaysia [UKM-GUP-2011-034, UKM-DLP-2011-002, FRGS/1/2012/TK03/UKM/02/4]","This research is supported by a research grants to the first author by Smart Engineering System, and Water and Environmental Research Group, University Kebangsaan Malaysia; UKM-GUP-2011-034, UKM-DLP-2011-002 and FRGS/1/2012/TK03/UKM/02/4.",,62,20,20,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

Result of the first order factorial design showed that acetic acid concentration, acid extraction time, acetic acid to muscles ratio, and stirring speed posed significant effect (P < 0.05) on the yield of PSC obtained at the end of the extraction process. Two different artificial intelligence techniques namely artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) were then integrated for optimizing the extraction conditions to obtain the highest yield of PSC. The ANN was trained using the back propagation algorithm. A model was successfully generated with R (2) value of 0.9527 and MSE value of 0.1672 for unseen data set, implying a good generalization of the network. Input parameters of the established ANN model were subsequently optimized using GA. The hybrid of ANN-GA model predicted a maximum extraction yield of PSC at 238.25 mg/g under the following conditions: an acetic acid concentration of 0.70 M, the acetic acid to muscles ratio of 25.78 mL/g, and the stirring speed of 432.50 rpm. Verification of the optimization showed the percentage error differences between the experimental and predicted values were less than 5%, indicating excellent modeling, predicting ability and optimization by the ANN-GA model.","[Kiew, Peck Loo; Ahmad, Zainal; Don, Mashitah Mat] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Chem Engn, George Town, Malaysia","Kiew, PL (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Chem Engn, George Town, Malaysia.",peckloo@gmail.com; chmashitah@eng.usm.my,"Kiew, Peck Loo/AAD-2762-2019; MAT DON, MASHITAH/H-3660-2014; Ahmad, Zainal/A-7053-2011","Kiew, Peck Loo/0000-0001-5051-9909; MAT DON, MASHITAH/0000-0001-7584-7255; Ahmad, Zainal/0000-0003-4134-2173",Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM)Universiti Sains Malaysia; Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia [203/PJKIMIA/6730068],The authors gratefully acknowledge the USM Fellowship provided by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) and Exploratory Research Grant Scheme (ERGS) with grant number: 203/PJKIMIA/6730068 from the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia to support this research.

Quantitation of NH3 was based on the chemical reaction of NH3 with cobalt(II) (Co2+) ions in basic medium to form a blue hexamminecobaltate(II) ([Co(NH3)(6)](2+)) complex. Characterizations of Co2+ ion in solution included photostability, pH effect, response time, Co2+ ion concentration effect, dynamic linear range and reproducibility, which were performed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer. The pink cobalt species gradually changed to blue with increasing NH3 concentration. The absorption calibration curve was linear over the NH3 concentration range of 0.6-3.5 mM at optimum pH 8 with a reproducibility relative standard deviation (RSD) of <4.0%. The interference effect was found to be negligible for a number of foreign ions present in the reaction medium during NH3 determination in an aqueous environment. A set of absorbance data for the [Co(NH3)(6)](2+) complex at selected wavelengths was input for ANN training using a back-propagation algorithm. The trained network with 22 hidden neurons, a 28 500 epoch number and 0.001% learning rate has extended the dynamic NH3 concentration range to 0.6-5.9 mM with a calibration error as low as 0.0649 x 10(-3).

Here, each interaction is covered at most once whenever possible. In many AI-based strategies, sampling for the most optimal test cases is given utmost priority, but measuring of the interaction coverage metric per test case is often neglected. In the situation where not all test cases can be executed due to constraints on project deadline, the availability of interaction coverage metric per test case can be a useful indicator on how greedy each AI-based strategy of interests is. In this manner, test engineers can make informed decision on the selection of suitable strategies for use. In this paper, this study presents a systematic analysis of existing AI-based strategies including that of Hill Climbing HC, Simulated Annealing SA, Tabu Search TS, Great Flood GF, Particle Swarm Optimization PSTG and Harmonic Search Strategy HSS as far as its rate of coverage per test case is concerned. In doing so, this paper demonstrates that HSS, in most cases, gives competitive interaction coverage rate as compared to competing AI-based strategies but with less number of iterations.","[Al-Sewari, AbdulRahman A.] Dar Alsalam Int Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sanaa, Yemen; [Khamis, Norazlina] Univ Malaya, Dept Software Engn, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Zamli, Kamal Z.] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Comp Sci & Software Engn, Kuantan 26300, Pahang, Malaysia","Zamli, KZ (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Comp Sci & Software Engn, Kuantan 26300, Pahang, Malaysia.",kamalz@ump.edu.my,"Alsewari, AbdulRahman Ahmed/Q-3966-2019; Zamli, Kamal Z./AAF-4470-2019; KHAMIS, NORAZLINA/B-9347-2010","Alsewari, AbdulRahman Ahmed/0000-0002-7802-6628; ",Universiti Malaysia Pahang,This research is partially funded by the generous Short Term Grant (Development of a Pairwise Interaction Testing Strategy with Check-pointing Recovery Support) from Universiti Malaysia Pahang.,,25,1,1,0,8,"UNIV MALAYA, FAC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECH",KUALA LUMPUR,"UNIV MALAYA, FAC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECH, KUALA LUMPUR, 50603, MALAYSIA",0127-9084,,,MALAYS J COMPUT SCI,Malayas.

Alternator output is proportional to load angle, but as the parameter is moved up, the power system security approaches the extreme limit. Hence, generators are operated well below their steady state stability limit for the secure operation of a power system. This raises demand for efficient and fast controllers. Artificial intelligence, specifically artificial neural network (ANN), is emerging very rapidly and has become an efficient tool for operation and control of power systems. ANN requires considerable time to tune weights, but it is fast and accurate once tuned properly. Previously, ANNs have been trained with high-dimensional input space or have been trained online. Hence, either one requires considerable time to yield the control signal or is a bit risky technique to apply in interconnected power systems. In this study, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN is proposed to control generator excitation trained with low-dimensional input space. Moreover, MLP has been trained offline to avert the risk potential of online training. The results illustrate preeminence of the proposed neurocontroller-based excitation system over the conventional controllers-based excitation system.","[Abro, Abdul Ghani; Saleh, Junita Mohamad] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Perai 14300, Penang, Malaysia","Saleh, JM (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Engn Campus, Perai 14300, Penang, Malaysia.",jms@eng.usm.my,"Mohamad-Saleh, Junita/D-2724-2019","Mohamad-Saleh, Junita/0000-0003-3447-6050","Institute of Postgraduate Studies, University Sains Malaysia","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Institute of Postgraduate Studies, University Sains Malaysia, fellowship scheme for the financial support.",,32,0,0,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0883-9514,1087-6545,,APPL ARTIF INTELL,Appl.

One way to generate wind velocity is from the fifth generation PENN/NCAR MM5 mesoscale model. However, there is a problem in using wind speed data in hydrological processes due to large errors obtained from the mesoscale model MM5. The theme of this article has been focused on hybridization of MM5 with four mathematical models (two regression models- the multiple linear regression (MLR) and the nonlinear regression (NLR), and two artificial intelligence models - the artificial neural network (ANN) and the support vector machines (SVMs)) in such a way so that the properly modelled schemes reduce the wind speed errors with the information from other MM5 derived hydro-meteorological parameters. The forward selection method was employed as an input variable selection procedure to examine the model generalization errors. The input variables of this statistical analysis include wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, pressure, solar radiation and rainfall from the MM5. The proposed conjunction structure was calibrated and validated at the Brue catchment, Southwest of England. The study results show that relatively simple models like MLR are useful tools for positively altering the wind speed time series obtaining from the MM5 model. The SVM based hybrid scheme could make a better robust modelling framework capable of capturing the non-linear nature than that of the ANN based scheme. Although the proposed hybrid schemes are applied on error correction modelling in this study, there are further scopes for application in a wide range of areas in conjunction with any higher end models.","[Ishak, Asnor Muizan; Srivastava, Prashant K.; Islam, Tanvir; Han, Dawei] Univ Bristol, Dept Civil Engn, WEMRC, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England; [Remesan, Renji] Univ Hull, Dept Geog, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Ishak, Asnor Muizan] Minist Nat Resources & Environm, Dept Irrigat & Drainage, Hydrol & Water Resources Div, Kuala Lumpur 68000, Malaysia","Ishak, A (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Dept Civil Engn, WEMRC, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England.",asnormuizan.ishak@bristol.ac.uk,"Islam, Tanvir/F-6922-2011; Remesan, Renji/H-6614-2013; Han, Dawei/F-9827-2010","Remesan, Renji/0000-0001-9948-4321; Han, Dawei/0000-0002-1858-0491; Islam, Tanvir/0000-0003-2429-3074","Public Services Department of Malaysian Government; Irrigation and Drainage Department, Malaysian Government","This research is funded by the Public Services Department of Malaysian Government.

In this investigation, the accuracy of artificial neural network training algorithm was applied in studying the effects of different parameters on the particles, including the AgNO3 concentration, reaction temperature, UV-visible wavelength, and montmorillonite (MMT) d-spacing on the prediction of size of silver nanoparticles. Analysis of the variance showed that the AgNO3 concentration and temperature were the most significant factors affecting the size of silver nanoparticles. Using the best performing artificial neural network, the optimum conditions predicted were a concentration of AgNO3 of 1.0 (M), MMT d-spacing of 1.27 nm, reaction temperature of 27 degrees C, and wavelength of 397.50 nm.","[Shabanzadeh, Parvaneh; Senu, Norazak] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Shameli, Kamyar] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Shameli, Kamyar] Mat & Energy Res Ctr, Nanotechnol & Adv Mat Dept, Alborz 31787316, Karaj, Iran; [Tabar, Maryam Mohaghegh] Univ Guilan, Dept Math, Fac Sci, Rasht 1914, Iran","Shabanzadeh, P (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",parvaneh.shabanzade@gmail.com,"Tabar, Maryam Mohaghegh/AAD-9946-2020; Senu, Norazak/G-2776-2014; Senu, Norazak/AAA-7683-2019","Senu, Norazak/0000-0001-8614-8281; Senu, Norazak/0000-0001-8614-8281; Mohagheghtabar, Maryam/0000-0002-1202-0776; shabanzadeh, parvaneh/0000-0001-9936-4979",,,,42,5,5,0,14,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",2090-9063,2090-9071,,J CHEM-NY,J.

A functional relationship has been established using GEP and its performance is compared with other inductive modelling techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and conventional regression-based techniques. Field data comprising 370 data sets were collected from the published literature and divided into calibration and validation (testing) data sets. The performance of GEP was found to be satisfactory and encouraging when compared with regression and ANN models in predicting bridge pier scour depth. GEP has the unique capability of providing a compact and explicit mathematical expression for computing bridge scour. This advantage of GEP over ANN is one of the main motivations for this work. The resulting GEP models add to the existing literature on artificial intelligence based inductive models that can be used effectively for bridge scour modelling.","[Khan, Mujahid; Tufail, Mohammad] Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Azamathulla, Hazi M.] Univ Sains Malaysia, River Engn & Urban Drainage Res Ctr REDAC, Penanag, Malaysia; [Ab Ghani, Aminuddin] Univ Sains Malaysia, River Engn & Urban Drainage Res Ctr REDAC, George Town, Malaysia","Khan, M (corresponding author), Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Peshawar, Pakistan.",,"Azamathulla, Hazi/AAZ-2020-2020; Mohammad, Azamathulla Hazi/F-6600-2010; Ghani, Aminuddin Ab/B-2529-2008","Azamathulla, Hazi/0000-0002-5436-4147; Ghani, Aminuddin Ab/0000-0002-8912-9569",,,,55,17,18,0,10,ICE PUBLISHING,WESTMINISTER,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",1741-7589,,,P I CIVIL ENG-WAT M,Proc.

Numerous computer-aided techniques for automated TB bacilli detection in sputum smears have been proposed over the past few years to improve the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the detection. However, little attention has focused on the detection of TB bacilli in tissue sections. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach for detecting the TB bacilli in tissue sections using image processing and neural networks. Images are obtained by scanning the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stained tissue slides under a light microscope equipped with a digital camera. Then, image segmentation using thresholding and clustering techniques is applied to remove the tissue and background pixels. After segmentation, a set of six morphological features; area, perimeter, shape factor, minimum and maximum distance of a pixel in the boundary from the centroid, and eccentricity, are calculated for each region to describe shape properties. Finally, a single hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN) is used to classify the regions into three types; TB, overlapped TB and non-TB using the morphological features. Three recent algorithms for training SLFN called extreme learning machine (ELM), online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) and the improved extreme learning machine are evaluated for the classification. Results show that SLFN trained using the improved ELM substantially outperforms the ELM and OS-ELM. Promising result with 88.37% of testing accuracy has been achieved for the method. Also, the SLFN with the improved ELM was found to require less number of hidden nodes during the training phase, resulting in faster response in the testing phase.","[Osman, Muhammad Khusairi] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Elect Engn, Permatang Pauh 13500, Penang, Malaysia; [Mashor, Mohd Yusoff] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Mechatron Engn, Elect & Biomed Intelligent Syst EBItS Res Grp, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia; [Jaafar, Hasnan] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Med Sci, Dept Pathol, Kubang Kerian 16150, Kelantan, Malaysia","Osman, MK (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Elect Engn, Penang Campus,Jalan Permatang Pauh, Permatang Pauh 13500, Penang, Malaysia.",,,,"Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) MalaysiaMinistry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia","This project was funded by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) Malaysia.",,19,3,3,0,2,AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS,VALENCIA,"26650 THE OLD RD, STE 208, VALENCIA, CA 91381-0751 USA",2156-7018,2156-7026,,J MED IMAG HEALTH IN,J.

In this study, the experimental data of glycerol removal by means of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) was used to design a new modeling approach based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in order to predict glycerol removal. The DESs were synthesized with choline chloride and methyl triphenyl phosphunium bromide as salts and different hydrogen bond donors. DESs composition and the mole fractions of DESs to biodiesel were used as inputs to the model. A feed-forward neural network with 4 hidden neurons was applied and training was done based on the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method. The ANN prediction was in good agreement with the measured data with an absolute average deviation of 6.46%. The predicted results indicated that the DESs synthesized with glycerol as hydrogen bond donor has lower removal efficiencies. Furthermore, the phosphunium-based DESs were much efficient in attracting total glycerol in comparison with ammonium-based DESs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Because of the inundation of floodplains and sudden changes in river geometry, flow resistance equations are not applicable for compound channels. Therefore, many approaches have been developed for modification of flow discharge computations. Most of these methods have satisfactory results only in laboratory flumes. Due to the ability to model complex phenomena, the artificial intelligence methods have recently been employed for wide applications in various fields of water engineering. Linear genetic programming (LGP), a branch of artificial intelligence methods, is able to optimise the model structure and its components and to derive an explicit equation based on the variables of the phenomena. In this paper, a precise dimensionless equation has been derived for prediction of flood discharge using LGP. The proposed model was developed using published data compiled for stage-discharge data sets for 394 laboratories, and field of 30 compound channels. The results indicate that the LGP model has a better performance than the existing models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Many AI-based strategies have been developed, such as Ant Colony, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, and Tabu Search. Although useful, most existing AI-based t-way testing strategies adopt complex search processes and require heavy computations. For this reason, existing AI-based t-way testing strategies have been confined to small interaction strengths (i.e., t <= 3) and small test configurations. Recent studies demonstrate the need to go up to t = 6 in order to capture most faults. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Particle Swarm-based t-way Test Generator (PSTG) for generating uniform and variable strength covering arrays. Unlike other existing AI-based t-way testing strategies, the lightweight computation of the particle swarm search process enables PSTG to support high interaction strengths of up to t = 6. The performance of our proposed PSTG is evaluated using several sets of benchmark experiments. Comparatively, PSTG consistently outperforms its AI counterparts and other existing testing strategies as far as the size of the array is concerned. Furthermore, our case study demonstrates the usefulness of PSTG for facilitating fault detection owing to interactions of the input components. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The spreading merit of WSAN has led to increasing interest in rendering them with expert knowledge to be smart and autonomous networks, which have the potential to enable a large class of applications in multiple fields. Fusion of artificial intelligent with wireless sensor actor networks (WSAN) is emerging as a new generation of smart autonomous WSAN. Primarily two most important greenhouse climate parameters are considered which are the temperature and humidity during diurnal and nocturnal time. Actuator and sensor nodes has been managed by cognitive wireless sensor-actor network based greenhouse (CWSAN-GH) Coordinator node (MGHSN) which mimics the brain of the laborer to provide reliable, power conserving, autonomous control system of a greenhouse climate. Fuzzy logic controller enables engineers to control more complex systems more effectively than the conventional control methods which are not efficient in terms of energy, labor interference, productivity and flexibility. This paper presents the fusion of artificial intelligence represented by FIS with WSAN for greenhouse climate control. Also the long life operation of network nodes based on the low power consumption is presented. Smart algorithm of the network sensor nodes, which contributes of reducing the power consumption, is addressed in detail. Initial field test for the CWSAN-GH is presented too. The combination of AI with actor WSN proves high efficiently, cost effective method, beside flexibility of tuning the whole system for other agricultural tasks.","[Sabri, Naseer; Aljunid, S.

Folder allocation for text documents in computer is typically executed manually by the user. Every time the user creates text documents by using text editors or downloads the documents from the internet, and wishes to store these documents on the computer, the user needs to determine and allocate the appropriate folder in which to store these new documents. This situation is inconvenient as repeating the folder allocation each time a text document is stored becomes tedious especially when the numbers and layers of folders are huge and the structure is complex and continuously growing. This problem can be overcome by implementing Artificial Intelligence machine learning methods to classify the new text documents and allocate the most appropriate folder as the storage for them. In this paper we propose the Bayes-SVMs hybrid classification framework to perform the tedious task of automatically allocating the right folder for text documents in computers.","[Lee, Lam Hong] Jalan Univ, Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Kampar 31900, Perak, Malaysia; [Rajkumar, Rajprasad; Isa, Dino] Univ Nottingham, Fac Engn, Intelligent Syst Res Grp, Semenyih 43500, Selangor, Malaysia","Lee, LH (corresponding author), Jalan Univ, Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Kampar 31900, Perak, Malaysia.",leelh@utar.edu.my; Rajprasad.Rajkumar@nottingham.edu.my; Dino.Isa@nottingham.edu.my,"Lee, Lam Hong/B-7420-2014","Lee, Lam Hong/0000-0002-9911-2808","Faculty of Information and Communication Technology, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia","We would like to express our gratitude to Dr. Yen Kaow Ng from Faculty of Information and Communication Technology, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia, for his support and advice in this paper.",,29,13,13,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-669X,1573-7497,,APPL INTELL,Appl.

The optimum values of ammonia/nitric oxide ratio, temperature and superficial gas velocity for the maximum NO removal efficiency were found to be 1.5, 300 degrees C and 0.098 m/s, respectively. A mechanistic model was implemented in our previous study [Muhammad F. Irfan, Sang Done Kim and Muhammad R.

However, it failed to perfectly match with rest of the experimental data points at other temperatures and parametric conditions as well. To improve this, an artificial neural network modeling strategy was applied and its predictions were evaluated which were favorably matched with the experimental data rather than the mechanistic model.

Subjective lameness scoring, which is the most popular lameness detection and screening method in dairy herds, has several limitations. They include low intra-observer and inter-observer agreement and the discrete nature of the scores which limits its usage in monitoring the lameness. The aim of this study is to develop an automated lameness scoring system comparable with conventional subjective lameness scoring by means of artificial neural networks. The system is composed of four balanced force plates installed in a hoof-trimming box. A group of 105 dairy cows was used for the study. Twenty-three features extracted from ground reaction force (GRF) data were used in a computer training process which was performed on 60 per cent of the data. The remaining 40 per cent of the data were used to test the trained system. Repeatability of the lameness scoring system was determined by GRF samples from 25 cows, captured at two different times from the same animals. The mean sd was 0.31 and the mean coefficient of variation was 14.55 per cent, which represents a high repeatability in comparison with subjective vision-based scoring methods. Although the highest sensitivity and specificity values were seen in locomotion score groups 1 and 4, the automatic lameness system was both sensitive and specific in all groups. The sensitivity and specificity were higher than 72 per cent in locomotion score groups 1 to 4, and it was 100 per cent specific and 50 per cent sensitive for group 5.","[Ghotoorlar, S.

However, artificial intelligent models are trained using large amount of data obtained from the operation of the off-road vehicle. In contrast, fuzzy knowledge-based models are developed by using the experience of the traction in order to maintain the vehicle traction as required with utilizing optimum power. The main goal of this paper is to describe fuzzy knowledge-based model to be practically applicable to a reasonably wide class of unknown nonlinear systems. Compared with conventional control approach, fuzzy logic approach is more efficient for nonlinear dynamic systems and embedding existing structured human knowledge into workable mathematics. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between vehicle's input parameters of power supply (PI) and moisture content (MC) and output parameter of traction force (TF). Experiment has been conducted in the field to investigate the vehicle traction and the result has been compared with the developed fuzzy logic system (FLS) based on Mamdani approach. Results show that the mean relative error of actual and predicted values from the FLS model on TF is found as 7%, which is less than the acceptable limit of 10%. The goodness of fit of the prediction value from FLS is found close to 1.0 as expected and hence shows the good performance of the developed system.

In this study, densities of three classes of deep eutectic solvents, based on a phosphonium and two ammonium salts, were measured. Two predictive models based on artificial intelligence and group contribution methods were proposed for accurate estimation and evaluation of deep eutectic solvent densities. A feed forward back propagation neural network with 9 hidden neurons was successfully developed and trained with the measured density data. The group contribution method applied the modified Lydersen-Joback-Reid, Lee-Kesler and the modified Rackett equations. The comparison of the predicted densities with those obtained by measurement confirmed the reliability of the neural network and the group contribution method with average absolute errors of 0.14 and 2.03%, respectively. Comparison of the model performances indicated a better predictability of the developed neural network over the group contribution method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Mjalli, F.

Methods: Two models of multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network approaches based on decision support system were developed. The MLP model was used to optimize the predicting algorithm based on the conjugate gradients descent method. To design the RBF network, K-Means clustering technique was used to select the centers of RBFs, and k-nearest neighbourhood to define the spread and forward selection for determining the optimum number of RBFs. To assess the generalization of the network, K-fold cross-validation test was used. A total of 3,109 medical records containing 19 main clinical parameters were used to train and test the networks. Results: The findings indicate a reliable performance of the proposed system. The MLP based model yields a sensitivity, specificity, and an area under the receiver/relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 87.1%, 90%, and 0.887 +/- 0.02, respectively. However, the RBF network shows the above parameters as 84.4%, 94.3%, and 0.905 +/- 0.017, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed intelligence system achieved a high degree of diagnostic accuracy (92.9% for MLP and 93.7% for RBF) indicating its high efficiency for clinical diagnosis of LOHF.

Alternatively, there are also various power tracing methods developed by researchers, unfortunately, the application is rather limited as they are only applied for transmission service pricing, especially in deregulated power system. By incorporating the tracing algorithm, this paper intends to present a novel method for determining the exact locations for FACTS devices placement, that is, Fast Voltage Stability Index Load Tracing (FVSI-LT). After experimentation on IEEE 57-bus reliability test system (RTS) considering normal and multi-contingencies condition, it is revealed that the proposed method provides a sense of reliability in terms of voltage stability enhancement while at the same time proves its capability to be applied into real system. Moreover, a new hybrid algorithm, Blended Crossover Continuous Ant Colony Optimization (BX-CACO) has also been proposed and it is observed that this algorithm reflects an impressive performance in terms of computation time and solution optimality after comparing with other Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms.

To determine its efficiency in terms of the size of the generated test suite, VS-PSTG was subjected to well-known benchmark configurations. Comparative results indicate that VS-PSTG gives competitive results as compared to existing strategies.

However, GPS is incapable of providing permanent and reliable navigation solutions in the presence of signal evaporation or blockage. On the other hand, navigation systems, in particular, inertial navigation systems (INSs), have become important components in different military and civil applications due to the recent advent of micro-electromechanical systems (M EMS). Both INS and GPS systems are often paired together to provide a reliable navigation solution by integrating the long-term GPS accuracy with the short-term INS accuracy. This article presents an alternative method to integrate GPS and INS systems and provide a robust navigation solution. This alternative approach to Kalman filtering (KF) utilizes artificial intelligence based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to fuse data from both systems and estimate position and velocity errors. The KF is usually criticized for working only under predefined models and for its observability problem of hidden state variables, sensor error models, immunity to noise, sensor dependency, and linearization dependency. The training and updating of ANFIS parameters is one of the main problems. Therefore, the challenges encountered implementing an ANFIS module in real time have been overcome using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize the ANFIS learning parameters since PSO involves less complexity and has fast convergence. The proposed alternative method uses GPS with INS data and PSO to update the intelligent PANFIS navigator using GPS/INS error as a fitness function to be minimized. Three methods of optimization have been tested and compared to estimate the INS error. Finally, the performance of the proposed alternative method has been examined using real field test data of MEMS grade INS integrated with GPS for different GPS outage periods. The results obtained outperform KF, particularly during long GPS signal blockage.","[Hasan, Ahmed Mudheher; Samsudin, Khairulmizam] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Comp & Commun Syst, Comp Syst Res Grp, Serdang 43400, Malaysia; [Ramli, Abdul Rahman] Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Adv Technol, Intelligent Syst & Robot Lab, Serdang 43400, Malaysia","Hasan, AM (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Comp & Commun Syst, Comp Syst Res Grp, Serdang 43400, Malaysia.",gs20491@mutiara.upm.edu.my,"SAMSUDIN, KHAIRULMIZAM/AAB-6367-2021",", Khairulmizam/0000-0001-9379-3385","Computer Systems Engineering Research Group at the University Putra Malaysia, 43400 Serdang, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia; School of Graduate Studies","The authors would like to thank the Computer Systems Engineering Research Group at the University Putra Malaysia, 43400 Serdang, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia, for their continuous help and support.

A biofeedback system communicates with the human central nervous system through a variety of feedback modalities. Vibrotactile feedback devices are gaining attention due to their desirable characteristics and simplistic manner of presenting biofeedback. In this study, we investigate the potential of incorporating a real-time biofeedback system with artificial intelligence for wobble board training, aimed at improving ankle proprioception. The designed system utilizes vibrotactile actuators to provide forewarning for poor postural control. The biofeedback system depended on Euler angular measurements of trunk and wobble board displacements, from inertial measurement units (IMUs). A fuzzy inference system was used to determine the quality of postural control, based on IMU-acquired measurements of trunk and wobble board. The designed system integrates: 1) two IMUs, 2) a fuzzy knowledge base, and 3) a feedback-generation module. Tests were conducted in eyes-open and eyes-close conditions while standing on the wobble board to assess viability of the system in providing accurate real-time intervention. The results observed an improvement in postural controlwith biofeedback intervention, demonstrating successfulness of the prototype built for improving postural control in rehabilitative and preventive applications.","[Gopalai, Alpha Agape; Senanayake, S.

However, such models tend to perform well for predicting ETo close to the mean, but do not keep accurate performance with extreme observations. It is recognized that the Penman-Monteith (PM) model has the best performance when rich data is available to calculate the ETo, which is not frequently available to a certain extent. In case of poor data, such as prediction of futuristic ETo while investigating climate change effect, although there are models other than PM like Hargreaves-Samani (HGS), the universal sustainability of these models are not quit proved. Accordingly, the calculation of ETo still required numerous research to reach accurate estimation of ETo specially when there is lacking for data to utilize PM method. Recently, methods based on artificial intelligence (AI) have been suggested to provide reliable prediction model for several application in engineering. This manuscript employed artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting daily ETo at Rasht city located northern part of Iran using minimum and maximum daily temperatures collected from 1975 to 1988 of the region. A comprehensive data analysis utilizing the daily time series, minimum and maximum temperatures and solar radiation (T (min), T (max) and R (s)), as input pattern to predict daily ETo at the current month and for the following month is proposed. The employed ANN model was feed forward backpropagation (FFBP) type with Bayesian regulation backpropagation. The mean square error, mean absolute error, mean absolute relative error and regression coefficient are the statistical performance indices used to evaluate the model accuracy. The results showed that the proposed ANN model could successfully be used to predict daily ETo using only maximum and minimum temperatures with significant level of accuracy. In addition, results show that the proposed ANN model outperforms HGS method.","[Jahanbani, Heerbod] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Serdang, Malaysia; [El-Shafie, Ahmed Hussein] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Bangi 43600, Malaysia","Jahanbani, H (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, POB 43400, Serdang, Malaysia.",heerbode@gmail.com,"El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014","El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505",,,,25,16,18,1,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1611-2490,1611-2504,,PADDY WATER ENVIRON,Paddy Water Environ.,JUN,2011,9,2,,,,,207,220,,10.1007/s10333-010-0219-1,,,14,Agricultural Engineering; Agronomy,Agriculture,758NL,WOS:000290171400003,,,,,11/3/2021

This paper proposes a method for cutting parameters identification using Multi adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System (MANFIS). Three Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) models were used in the first step to identify the initial values for the cutting parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut) using surface roughness as a single input, in the next step these parameters were modified and verified using another set of ANFIS models. Then, workpiece surface temperature is used as input for another set of ANFIS models to amend the final values of the cutting parameters. In this way, multi-input-multi-output ANFIS structure presented, which can identify the cutting parameters accurately once the desired surface roughness and in-process measured surface temperature were entered to the system. The test results showed that the proposed MANFIS model can be used successfully for machinability data selection.","[Suhail, Adeel H.; Ismail, N.; Wong, S. V.; Jalil, N. A.

All existing AI-based methods are based on relating the INS error to the corresponding INS output at certain time instants and do not consider the dependence of the error on the past values of INS. This study, therefore, suggests the use of Input-Delayed Neural Networks (IDNN) to model both the INS position and velocity errors based on current and some past samples of INS position and velocity, respectively. This results in a more reliable positioning solution during long GPS outages. The proposed method is evaluated using road test data of different trajectories while both navigational and tactical grade INS are mounted inside land vehicles and integrated with GPS receivers. The performance of the IDNN - based model is also compared to both conventional (based mainly on Kalman filtering) and recently published Al - based techniques.

A fast and accurate technique to assess the level of system strength or weakness is some of the essential requirements for maintaining security of modern power systems, particularly in competitive energy markets. This paper presents intelligent artificial techniques for vulnerability assessment of Malaysian power system and recommends preventive control measures. Accurate techniques for vulnerability assessment and control of power systems are developed. In vulnerability assessment, power system loss index is used as a vulnerability parameter, neural network weight extraction is employed as the feature extraction method and the generalized regression neural network is used to predict vulnerability of a power system. As for vulnerability control, load shedding is considered by using the neuro-fuzzy technique. Finally, the paper presents and discusses the results from this research with recommendations.

Thus, neglecting creep could result in un-conservative design of new structures and/or underestimation of the level of its effect on stress redistribution in existing structures. Brickwork has substantial creep strain that is difficult to predict because of its dependence on many uncontrolled variables. Reliable and accurate prediction models for the long-term, time-dependent creep deformation of brickwork structures are needed. Artificial intelligence techniques are suitable for such applications. A model based on radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) is proposed for predicting creep and is compared to a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) model recently developed for the same purpose. Accurate prediction of creep was achieved due to the simple architecture and fast training procedure of RBFNN model especially when compared to MLPNN model. The RBFNN model shows good agreement with experimental creep data from brickwork assemblages collected over the last 15 years.","[El-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Abdelazim, T.] Univ Calgary, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Noureldin, A.] Royal Mil Coll Canada, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Kingston, ON, Canada","El-Shafie, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Bangi 43600, Malaysia.",elshafie@vlsi.eng.ukm.my; abdelasi@enel.ucalgary.ca; noureldin-a@rmc.ca,"Tamer Mellik, PEng/M-2462-2019; Noureldin, Aboelmagd/AAM-2759-2020; El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014","Tamer Mellik, PEng/0000-0002-5671-186X; Noureldin, Aboelmagd/0000-0001-6614-7783; El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505","Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Smart Engineering Research Group, University Kebangsaan Malaysia","This research is supported by (1) research grant to the third author from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada, (2) The research grant for the first author from Smart Engineering Research Group, University Kebangsaan Malaysia.

Finding efficient measurements for detecting fraudulent electricity consumption has been an active research area in recent years. This paper presents a new approach towards nontechnical loss (NTL) detection in power utilities using an artificial intelligence based technique, support vector machine (SVM). The main motivation of this study is to assist Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) Sdn. Bhd. in peninsular Malaysia to reduce its NTLs in the distribution sector due to abnormalities and fraud activities, i.e., electricity theft. The fraud detection model (FDM) developed in this research study preselects suspected customers to be inspected onsite fraud based on irregularities in consumption behavior. This approach provides a method of data mining, which involves feature extraction from historical customer consumption data. This SVM based approach uses customer load profile information and additional attributes to expose abnormal behavior that is known to be highly correlated with NTL activities. The result yields customer classes which are used to shortlist potential suspects for onsite inspection based on significant behavior that emerges due to fraud activities. Model testing is performed using historical kWh consumption data for three towns within peninsular Malaysia. Feedback from TNB Distribution (TNBD) Sdn. Bhd. for onsite inspection indicates that the proposed method is more effective compared to the current actions taken by them. With the implementation of this new fraud detection system TNBD's detection hitrate will increase from 3% to 60%.","[Nagi, Jawad; Tiong, Sieh Kiong] Univ Tenaga Nas, PEC, Kajang 43009, Selangor, Malaysia; [Yap, Keem Siah; Tiong, Sieh Kiong; Ahmed, Syed Khaleel] Univ Tenaga Nas, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Kajang 43009, Selangor, Malaysia; [Mohamad, Malik] TNBR, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia","Nagi, J (corresponding author), Univ Tenaga Nas, PEC, Kajang 43009, Selangor, Malaysia.",jawad@uniten.edu.my; yapkeem@uniten.edu.my; siehkiong@uniten.edu.my; syedkhaleel@uniten.edu.my; m.malik@tnbr.com.my,"Ahmed, Syed Khaleel/C-2329-2011","Yap, Keem Siah/0000-0002-5518-5132",Tenaga Nasional Berhad Distribution (TNBD) Sdn.

This accessibility has resulted in an increasing number of researches in data mining in which hidden predictive information are extracted from large databases, using techniques from database research, artificial intelligence and statistics, to a wide variety of domains such as finance, manufacturing and medicine. In this research we describe our experiments on the application of Classification And Regression Tree (CART) to predict the survival of AIDS. CART builds classification and regression trees for predicting continuous dependent variables and categorical or predictor variables, and by predicting the most likely value of the dependent variable. In this paper, a total of 998 patients who had been diagnosed with AIDS were grouped according to prognosis by CART. We found that CART were able to predict the survival of AIDS with an accuracy of 60-93% based on selected dependent variables, validated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC).

Although the rotor-AMB systems are open loop unstable, they are easily stabilized using feedback control schemes of which the PID controller is the most commonly used. The PID controller is however only effective at the vicinity of the rotor's equilibrium position where the dynamics of the rotor-AMB system is linearized. Significant deviation of the rotor's motion from this equilibrium position may occur due to large imbalance forces. In this situation, the nonlinearity in AMBs, which arises from the relationship between the electromagnetic force, coil current and air gap, may render the PID controller ineffective. For the control of nonlinear systems, artificial intelligence techniques such as fuzzy and hybrid techniques are effective. In this paper, a new fuzzy controller is proposed for the control of a single-axis AMB system. This controller is based on the bang-bang scheme, which is an old but effective technique to control nonlinear systems in optimal time. The performance of the proposed integrated fuzzy bang-bang relay controller (FBBRC) was found to be superior to that of the optimized PD controller and the conventional fuzzy logic controller. Comparison of the FBBRC with the fuzzy logic controller cascaded with a hard limiter (FBBC) relay revealed almost equal performance. High frequency chattering was however observed in the steady-state response of the FBBC. Such chattering is known to cause instability and distortion in the amplifiers that are used to supply current to the magnetic bearing actuators. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, it is of the essence to preserve its water and utilize it very efficiently. Developing inflow-forecasting model is considered the technical way to effectively achieve such preservation. The hydrological system of the Nile River under consideration has several dams and barrages that are equipped with control gates. The improvement of these hydraulic structures' criteria for operation can be assessed if reliable forecasts of inflows to the reservoir are available. Recently, the authors developed a forecasting model for the natural inflow at Aswan High Dam (AHD) based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). This model was developed based on the historical inflow data of the AHD and successfully provided accurate inflow forecasts with error less than 10%. However, having several forecasting models based on different types of data increase the level of confidences of the water resources planners and AHD operators. In this study, two forecasting model approach based on Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) method for the natural inflow at AHD utilizing the stream flow data of the monitoring stations upstream the AHD is developed. Natural inflow data collected over the last 30 years at four monitoring stations upstream AHD were used to develop the model and examine its performance. Inclusive data analysis through examining cross-correlation sequences, water traveling time, and physical characteristics of the stream flow data have been developed to help reach the most suitable RBFNN model architecture. The Forecasting Error (FE) value of the error and the distribution of the error are the two statistical performance indices used to evaluate the model accuracy. In addition, comprehensive comparison analysis is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed model over those recently developed for forecasting the inflow at AHD. The results of the current study showed that the proposed model improved the forecasting accuracy by 50% for the low inflow season, while keep the forecasting accuracy in the same range for the high inflow season.","[El-Shafie, Ahmed; Taha, Mohd R.] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Abdin, Alaa E.] Natl Water Res Ctr, Cairo, Egypt; [Noureldin, Aboelmagd] Royal Mil Coll Canada, Kingston, ON, Canada","El-Shafie, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",elshafie@vlsi.eng.ukm.my,"Noureldin, Aboelmagd/AAM-2759-2020; El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014","Noureldin, Aboelmagd/0000-0001-6614-7783; El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505; Taha, Mohd Raihan/0000-0001-6719-9147","Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Smart Engineering Research Group; University Kebangsaan Malaysia; Disaster Research Group; University Kebangsaan Malaysia Nile Sector; Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, Egypt","This research is supported by: (1) a research grant to the third author from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada.

GA is utilized to identify the best control action for the system by creating possible solutions and thereby to propose the correct control action to the reactor system. This value is then used as the set point for the closed loop control system of the heat exchanger. A continuous stirred tank reactor is chosen as a case study, where the controller is then tested with multiple set-point tracking and changes in its parameters. The GA model-based control (GAMBC) is then implemented experimentally to control the reactor temperature of a pilot plant, where an irreversible exothermic chemical reaction is simulated by using the calculated steam flow rate. The dynamic behavior of the pilot plant reactor during the online control studies is highlighted, and comparison with the conventional tuned proportional integral derivative (PID) is presented. It is found that both controllers are able to control the process with comparable performance.

In general, higher desulfurization activity correlates with higher sorbent surface area. Consequently, a major aim in sorbent synthesis is to maximize the sorbent surface area by optimizing the hydration conditions. This work presents an integrated modeling and optimization approach to sorbent synthesis based on statistical experimental design and two artificial intelligence techniques: neural network and genetic algorithm. In the first step of the approach, the main and interactive effects of three hydration variables on sorbent surface area were evaluated using a full factorial design. The hydration variables of interest to this study were hydration time, amount of coal fly ash, and amount of calcium sulfate and the levels investigated were 4-32 h, 5-15 g, and 0-12 g, respectively. In the second step, a neural network was used to model the relationship between the three hydration variables and the sorbent surface area. A genetic algorithm was used in the last step to optimize the input space of the resulting neural network model. According to this integrated modeling and optimization approach, an optimum sorbent surface area of 62.2 m(2) g(-1) could be obtained by mixing 13.1 g of coal fly ash and 5.5 g of calcium sulfate in a hydration process containing 100 ml of water and 5 g of calcium oxide for a fixed hydration time of 10 h.

Design/methodology/approach - The method uses the ANSYSTM finite element analysis tool along with Anand's viscoplastic constitutive law. Darveaux's crack growth rate model was applied to calculate solder joint characteristic life using simulated viscoplastic strain energy density results at the package substrate and printed circuit board solder joints. Two package configurations are evaluated with the above methodology, with the first being a simplified flip chip model and the second being a detailed flip chip model. Each of these configurations is subjected to two accelerated temperature cycling tests. Findings - Generally, the results indicate that the solder joint at the corner end of the package tends to fail first. The characteristic lives of solder joint at the package ball/board interface are 24-46 percent higher than the characteristic lives of solder joint at the package ball/substrate interface. This means that the interface between the solder ball and substrate will fail first before the interface between the solder ball and the board. Originality/value - Demonstrates that genetic algorithms can be used as tools to predict possible package dimensional values for given constraints on solder joint life.","Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Mech Engn, George Town, Malaysia; Intel Shanghai, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Azid, IA (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Mech Engn, George Town, Malaysia.",ishak@eng.usm.my,,,,,,8,1,1,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-5362,1758-812X,,MICROELECTRON INT,Microelectron.

The approach used the coevolution of a fixed-architecture neural-network-based evaluation function combined with a standard minimax search algorithm. Comparisons between evolving neural networks and computer players that used deterministic strategies allowed evolution to be observed in real-time. Neural networks evolved to outperform the computer players playing at higher ply-depths, despite being handicapped by playing black and using minimax at ply-depth of two. In addition, the playing ability of the population progressed from novice, to intermediate, and then to master's level. Individual neural networks discovered various game-playing strategies, starting with positional and later mobility. These results show that neural networks can be evolved as evaluation functions, despite the general difficulties associated with this approach. Success in this case was due to a simple spatial preprocessing layer in the neural network that captured spatial information, self-adaptation of every weight and bias of the neural network, and a selection method that allowed a diverse population of neural networks to be carried forward from one generation to the next.","Univ Birmingham, Sch Comp Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; Multimedia Univ, Fac Engn & Technol, Melaka 75450, Malaysia; Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan","Chong, SY (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Comp Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",s.y.chong@cs.bham.ac.uk; iem_nat@yahoo.com; whitejd@xiaotu.com,"White, Jonathon David/C-7962-2009; Tan, Mingkui/T-2667-2019","White, Jonathon David/0000-0002-2250-1629; Chong, Siang Yew/0000-0002-0040-6575",,,,47,26,26,0,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1089-778X,1941-0026,,IEEE T EVOLUT COMPUT,IEEE Trans.

All models are constructed to allow them to be modelled as a function of flux linkage against current with rotor position as an undetermined parameter.

Traditional Statistical Process Control (SPC) charting, a popular monitoring and diagnosis tool, is being improved to be more sensitive to small changes and to include more intelligence to handle dynamic process information. Artificial neural network-based SPC chart pattern recognition schemes have been introduced by several researchers. These schemes need further improvement in terms of generalization and recognition performance. One possible approach is through improvement in data representation using features extracted from raw data. Most of the previous work in intelligent SPC used raw data as input vector representation. The literature reports limited work dealing with features, but it lacks extensive comparative studies to assess the relative performance between the two approaches. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative performance of a feature-based SPC recognizer compared with the raw data-based recognizer. Extensive simulations were conducted using synthetic data sets. The study focused on recognition of six commonly researched SPC patterns plotted on the Shewhart X-bar chart. The ANN-based SPC pattern recognizer trained using the six selected statistical features resulted in significantly better performance and generalization compared with the raw data-based recognizer. Findings from this study can be used as guidelines in developing better SPC recognition systems.","Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Mech Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia","Hassan, A (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Mech Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia.",,"Hassan, Adnan/Q-2617-2019","Hassan, Adnan/0000-0002-3980-8942",,,,28,96,107,1,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

A common conclusion that emerges from such studies is that the FL control provides superior performance. However, such a conclusion usually is based on a limited simulation and/or experimental study. It appears that a thorough comparison of the drive behavior under PI and FL speed control, using simulations and an experimental rig, is still missing. This paper attempts to provide such an in-depth comparison of the operation of a vector-controlled permanent magnet synchronous motor. Speed responses under PI and FL speed control are at first simulated and then measured on the experimental rig for a variety of operating conditions. Two different machines are used in simulation and experimentation, enabling a better generalization of the results. The transients studied include response to a large step speed command from standstill with nominal inertia and an increased inertia, response to a small step speed reference change, response to a step load torque application, and a reversing transient. The transient behavior is examined for various initial speed settings, so that a thorough comparison is enabled. It is shown that superiority of the FL speed control is much less pronounced than it is often portrayed in literature on the basis of limited comparisons. Indeed, in a number of cases PI speed control provided a superior speed response. Predictions obtained by simulations and experimental results are found to be in reasonable agreement, considering all the differences between the simulation and experimental study.","Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Engn, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England; SIRIM Berhad, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia","Levi, E (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Engn, Byrom St, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England.",,,,,,,16,6,6,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1532-5008,,,ELECTR POW COMPO SYS,Electr.

These level-of-processing are imbedded into various models of information retrieval. Conventional information retrieval models, such as Boolean and vector space models rely on an extensive use of keywords, as independent strings, and their frequencies in storing and retrieving information. Thus string processing and morphological processing are mainly adopted in these models.

Finally, the paper describes a pilot cell developed to test the CMS design.","Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Dept Engn, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; Sultan Zainal Abidin Islam Coll, Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia; Univ Manchester, Dept Mech Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England; Univ Salford, Sch Engn, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England","Harrison, DK (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Dept Engn, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",dha2@gcal.ac.uk,"Mohamed, Saiful Bahri/A-1175-2017","Mohamed, Saiful Bahri/0000-0002-4632-5631",,,,22,6,6,0,4,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

The approach uses a backpropagation 4-2-3 net (BPN) trained based on inputs/outputs data which were taken from simulation works carried out through a CAE software. The system reduces the time required for planning and optimizing of process conditions or operating parameters.

Due to their distinct properties and advantages, they are currently being investigated and integrated to form new models or strategies in the areas of system control. In this paper, a neuro-fuzzy controller (referred to as NFCGA) based on the radial basis function neural network is tuned automatically using genetic algorithms (GA). A linear mapping method is used to encode the GA chromosome, which consists of the width and centre of the membership functions, and also the weights of the controller. Dynamic crossover and mutation probabilistic rates are also applied for faster convergence of the GA evolution. Application of the NFCGA to a coupled-tank liquid-level laboratory process is investigated in this paper. Compared to a manually-tuned conventional fuzzy logic controller and a proportional-plus-integral-plus-derivative (PID) controller which are applied to the same process, the NFCGA shows considerable robustness and advantages.
