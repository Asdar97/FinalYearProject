However, MXene in electrocatalysis area for fuel cell is not discovered yet. Therefore, the aim of this study is to enhance the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) electrocatalyst performance using combination of bimetallic PtRu and MXene. Optimization is carried out using response surface methodology (RSM). Composition of MXene, Nafion content and methanol concentration are used as factors (input) and current density is used as a response (output) for the optimization analysis. A cyclic voltammetry (CV) is used to measure the current density. RSM generates optimum factors with MXene composition 78.90 wt%, Nafion content 19.71 wt% and methanol concentration of 2.82M. The optimum response is predicted to be 186.59mA/mg(PtRu). The validation test is carried out and the result shows that the average current density is 187.05mA/mg(PtRu). PtRu/MXene electrocatalyst produces 2.34 times higher current density compared to PtRu/C commercial electrocatalyst. This indicates that MXene has high potential as a nanocatalyst for cleaner energy production through the fuel cell. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The core of this work builds on a novel framework to determine the energy demand of BEBs and their potential as a replacement for diesel-powered buses in transportation networks. This paper uses data mapping technology from the Geographical Information System to cover the potential analysis of BEB penetration for large-scale bus networks. State-of-the-art methods have previously estimated the energy consumption of a BEB by using simulator models for each driving cycle, but these studies have not considered the actual elevation data of a local bus route. In fact, the developed a longitudinal dynamic model with a spatial version of a digital elevation model to determine the energy demand of a large-scale BEB network. Additionally, this work assessed two charging protocols-opportunity charging and overnight charging-according to the operating environments of electric buses. The application of the framework is validated in a case study to electrify the entire Rapid Kuala Lumpur bus (Bus Rapid KL) network in Malaysia. The proposed model used real-world data, which are typically available only to bus transit administration operators. In this paper, the data for bus route lines, bus station locations, and the number of passengers riding the Bus-Rapid KL were considered to formulate the forecasting longitudinal and temporal model by using passenger information system data. The results showed a penetration impact of the BEB charging demand during daytime and nighttime in an urban area in Kuala Lumpur. The proposed forecasting paradigm may permit power network operators to predict the optimal electric bus charging demand based on actual BEB consumption through the bus paths.","[Al-Ogaili, Ali Saadon; Ramasamy, Agileswari; Hashim, Tengku Juhana Tengku; Verayiah, Renuga; Marsadek, Marayati] Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Power Engn IPE, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Al-Masri, Ahmed N.] Amer Univ Emirates, Coll Educ, Dubai 503000, U Arab Emirates; [Hoon, Yap] Taylors Univ, Sch Engn, Fac Innovat & Technol, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia; [Jebur, Mustafa Neamah] Imam Jaafar Al Sadiq Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Missan, Iraq","Al-Ogaili, AS (corresponding author), Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Power Engn IPE, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia.",Ali.Saadon@uniten.edu.my,,,Universiti Tenaga Nasional BOLD Publication Fund [RJ010436494/iRMC/Publication/2019],This work was supported by Universiti Tenaga Nasional BOLD Publication Fund [grant number RJ010436494/iRMC/Publication/2019.,,31,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

The photovoltaic thermal PVT system is a suitable technology to improve electrical performance and obtain useful heat, which improves the overall efficiency. To overcome the challenges, a new dual oscillating absorber copper pipeline flow that was designed based on the PVT water system, was developed and studied. ANSYS 19.2 was used to predict the outlet water temperature and surface temperature of PVT model based numerical simulations, were irradiation levels of 600, 800, and 1000 W/m(2) with the mass flow rate at 2, 4, and 5 LPM and water temperature inlet 26 degrees C. The experiment was conducted outdoors under Malaysian weather conditions at different value flow rates of 2-6 LPM for the present investigation. The CFD results were validated with the experimental results. Validation ensures good agreement between the numerical and experimental results. The results show that the maximum average thermal efficiency of photovoltaic thermal (PVT) system is 59.6%. The highest average value of electrical efficiency of PV panel and the PVT water system was found to be 10.86% and 11.71%, respectively at a mass flow rate 6 LPM. The PVT electrical, thermal efficiency and the output power increased with the increase in mass flow. The thermal efficiency increased with the increase in the mass flow rate, solar irradiation level and reducing the difference between water inlet and outlet temperature. While, the cell temperature decrease with the increase in the mass flow rate. The maximum electrical performance achieved using the PVT system 11.71%. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Magnesium plates AZ31 are used as the anode, and air electrode as the cathode. This study also considers physical characteristics such as SEM, EDX and corrosion test while chemical characterization by performance test with difference electrolyte, anode, and roughness. Catechol-3,5-disulfbnic acid disodium salt (tiron) as anti-deposition used to reduce the deposition of Mg(OH)(2) on the anode and cathode surfaces and thus improve the performance of MAFC. From the performance study, the MAFC able to produce a power density of 27.54 mW/cm(2) which is high compare to the MAFC without tiron. Therefore, with the active area by 110.25 cm(2), the MAFC generates 2.93 W. The deposition of Mg(OH)(2) reduces the active area of magnesium oxidation, thus, reduce the electricity generation.

Adding filler into the membrane matrix had reported in improved performance of the DMFC. However, addition of filler will lead to the decrease of the ion exchange capacity of the membrane, which will in turn reduce the fuel cell performance. Hence, this work studies the modification of rice husk ash via sulfonation process and the effect of the synthesis parameter of novel sulfonated polyimides/sulfonated rice husk ash (SPI/sRHA) composite membrane towards fuel cell performance where filler sRHA had been synthesized via the mixing reaction between rice husk ash (RHA) with chloroform and chlorosulfonic acid. The composition of filler in membranes was optimized with different synthesis parameters such as different types of filler used, loading of filler in membrane and membrane annealing temperature. Investigation of the effects for these three parameters on the physicochemical properties of the composite membranes produced was carried out using response surface methodology (RSM) approach to optimize the synthesis parameters of the composite membrane. The fillers and composite membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis and transmission electron microscopy. Different synthesis parameters had shown different influences on the physicochemical properties of the composite membranes and consequently, gave different passive fuel cell performances of DMFCs too. The optimized membrane (S-12-sR) showed enhanced physicochemical performance as well as the passive single cell performance as compared to pure SPI and Nafion 117 membranes. The water uptake, proton conductivity and IEC that had been achieved by the optimized membrane were 90.97%, 0.1891 S cm(-2) and 0.2608 mmol g(-2) respectively.

This study determines design of coating parameters including gas flow rate, DC power, and deposition time of coating for metal bipolar plates, which can be an indicator of the suitability of these plates for use as bipolar plates in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) applications. The aim of this research was to obtain a limitation range value of parameters that can be used as a standard for the use of metal plates as bipolar plates. The optimization parameters designed by Taguchi are used to determine the characteristics of interfacial contact resistance (ICR) and corrosion current density (I-corr). The integration of the Taguchi method with simulation can show the optimal design parameters of the coating on the various materials use.

The obtained powders were dried and then calcined at temperatures of 600, 700 and 800 degrees C, respectively. The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of calcination temperature on the properties of GDC10. The powders were characterized using XRF, TGA, XRD, and PSA instruments. XRF analysis shows the presence of Ce, Gd and O elements in stoichiometric composition without any impurities. XRD analysis showed single phase structure of CeO2 where the crystallite size and lattice parameter increases and decreases, respectively, as the calcination temperature increases. The smallest particle size of 647.3 nm was obtained at the calcination temperature of 600 degrees C. The density of all GDC10 samples sintered at 1350 degrees C was found to be higher than 95%. In addition, the calcination temperature also influenced the ionic conductivity where the highest obtained value was 0.0153 S.cm(-1) at 800 degrees C for the sample calcined at 600 degrees C.

In this study, four important dimensionless flow parameters such as Reynolds number, P ' eclet number, Schmidt number, and Sherwood number were used for systematic analysis of hydrodynamic effects and power performance of recirculation mode microbial fuel cells together with computational fluid dynamics method. Results showed that the higher value of Reynolds number enhanced the convective flow of anolyte due to the dominant inertial forces in the flow field. Therefore, Reynolds number of 1.6 x 10(1) were obtained high mass transfer coefficient of 4.76 x 10(-7) m s(-1) and thin diffusion layer thickness of 2.52 x 10(-3) m.

Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is recognized as a sustainable approach to simultaneously generate power and treat wastewater through the employment of microorganisms as catalyst. The use of buffer solution in the wastewater treatment makes the commercial application of MFCs challenging due to their environmental impact and high costs. This work uses rotational motion to generate the flow stress in the anode chamber of the MFCs to enhance biofilm growth and mass transfer that leads to an overall performance improvement of the system. The effects on pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and power density were evaluated under rotational speeds of the magnetic stirrer from 0 to 640 rpm. The influence of the stirrer was then assessed utilizing the same parameters specified for scenarios with and without buffer. The results reveal that at 480 rpm of stirring speed, the pH value was neutral with a maximum COD removal of 82 % for bufferless and 93 % for buffered scenarios. In addition, for bufferless operation at 480 rpm yielded a power density of 402 mWm(-2). The results of the flow stress analysis for bufferless and buffered MFCs are beneficial for the commercialization and future development of the system for wastewater treatment applications.","[Wang, Chin-Tsan; Wu, Men-Wei] Natl Ilan Univ, Dept Mech & Electromech Engn, Yilan, Taiwan; [Tang, Raymond Chong Ong; Chong, Wen-Tong] Univ Malaya, Dept Mech Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Garg, Akhil] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Automot Res & Tribol, Delhi, India; [Ubando, Aristotle T.; Culaba, Alvin] De La Salle Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Manila, Philippines; [Ubando, Aristotle T.; Culaba, Alvin] De La Salle Univ, Ctr Engn & Sustainable Dev Res, Manila, Philippines; [Ong, Hwai-Chyuan] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Informat Syst & Modelling, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia","Wang, CT (corresponding author), Natl Ilan Univ, Dept Mech & Electromech Engn, Yilan, Taiwan.",ctwang@niu.edu.tw,"Ong, Hwai Chyuan/A-9492-2013","Ong, Hwai Chyuan/0000-0002-6731-4800","NSC TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 16-2923-E-197-01-MY3, 106-2622-E-197-0-CC3, 106-2221-E-197-019]","The authors acknowledged the generous funding support from NSC Taiwan under contracts MOST 16-2923-E-197-01-MY3, 106-2622-E-197-0-CC3 and 106-2221-E-197-019.

Cytotoxicity studies were conducted by assessing the cell viability and cell morphology of mouse fibroblast cell line (L929) and hamster lung fibroblast cell line (V79) via tetrazolium salt 3-(4-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and microscopic methods, respectively.

In this study, the resistance of natural pozzolan (NP) based alkali activated concrete (AAC) incorporating nanosilica (nSiO(2)) to chloride penetration and chloride-induced corrosion was evaluated. The performance of AAC upon exposure to chloride environment was assessed by conducting rapid chloride permeability, chloride migration and chloride-induced corrosion by measuring half-cell corrosion potentials, corrosion current density (I-corr) and gravimetric weight loss of embedded rebar. Additionally, accelerated corrosion by impressed anodic potential was conducted to validate the results. The chloride permeability was classified between moderate and high, while the chloride migration coefficient was in the range of 6.22 to 12.82 (x10(-12)) m(2)/s, lowest in the 7.5%-nSiO(2) modified AAC followed by 5%-nSiO(2). Though the corrosion potentials were more negative, the Icorr was in the range of 0.385 to 0.636 mu A/cm(2) in various AAC mixes as compared to 0.425 mu A/cm(2) recorded in the OPC concrete. The gravimetric weight loss of steel embedded in the AAC prepared with 0, 1, 2.5, 5 and 7.5% nSiO(2) was 1.61, 0.99, 0.79, 0.67 and 0.68%, respectively. Therefore, it is postulated that the durability of AAC was comparable to that of OPC concrete exposed to chloride environment and the blend of 5-7.5% of nSiO(2) in to NP outperformed other AAC mixes. However, it appears from the results that the electrochemical measurements do not reflect the accurate condition of the rebar embedded in AAC that could be attributed to lack of oxygen at the rebar level and lower pH in these binders. Hence, the specifications originally designed for OPC to assess the condition of the rebar may not be appropriate to be applicable for AAC. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed recovery system is compared with the basic heat recovery system, which only employs a heat exchanger and an absorption chiller. The simulation study is conducted for the systems investigating the improvement in terms of energy, economic and environmental criteria. From the results, it reveals that the proposed heat recovery system achieves an efficiency of 11.38% higher and the grid consumption of 12.85% lower than the basic recovery system when the system was applied for gridconnected with electric vehicle supply attached.

With the aid of the CL and voltage multiplier cell, the suggested topology can obtain ultra-high-voltage gain without a large turn ratio and extreme duty cycle. A passive clamp circuit is utilised in the structure of the introduced converter for not only alleviating voltage spike on the main switch effectively but also recycle the leakage inductance energy. So low-voltage rating and low on-state resistance metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor is allowed to increase efficiency and lower the conduction losses. The input current ripple of the suggested topology is very low due to connecting an inductor to the suggested structure input section, which is very friendly and desirable to the photovoltaic and fuel cell applications. The suggested converter steady-state analysis, operation principle, theoretical efficiency analysis, and design procedure are described comprehensively in this study. Furthermore, the suggested converter superiority is illustrated over various alike recently introduced the most important DC-DC structures in the comparison study.

Maximum ion exchange capacity and ionic conductivity for the composite membranes were obtained as 2.84 mmol/g and 80.2 mS/cm (50 degrees C) which was 21% and 47% higher as compared to pure ImPS membrane. Alkaline stability of the blend membranes was increased due to strong interaction between ZrO2 and ImPS molecules. Fuel cell performance using Pt/C catalysts exhibited OCP and power density elevation with incremental amounts of ZrO2 in the composite membrane composition. ImPS membrane with 10% ZrO2 recorded a highest OCP and power density of 1.04 V and 270 mW/cm(2) which was 35% and 39% higher than the pure ImPS.

In this study, mild post sulfonation of a polyether ketone ether ketone ketone (PEKEKK) has been successfully achieved using 98% H2SO4 at 90 degrees C under reflux. 5%-30% (wt%) of sulfonated PEKEKK (SPEKEKK) loaded polysulfone (PSU) composite membranes were fabricated via a solution casting method. Ingeminating evidence of the sulfonation and structure of sulfonated polymer was proved by H-1 NMR peaks integration data and FTIR, respectively. The addition of SPEKEKK to PSU showed significant improvement in conductivity owing to the availability of more protonated sites (-SO3H) and water mediated pathways for the conduction of protons. The composite membrane containing 30 wt% SPEKEKK exhibits the highest conductivity of 0.12 S/cm at 90 degrees C. The water uptakes and swelling ratio of the composite membranes are all higher than that of the pristine PSU membrane and show an increasing trend with increasing SPEKEKK content, thus validating the availability of water domains. Meanwhile, the lowest initial decomposition temperatures assigned to sulfonic acid groups and main chain degradation of the polysulfone/polyether ketone ether ketone ketone (PSU/SPEKEKK) composite membranes occurred at similar to 300 degrees C and similar to 500 degrees C respectively, which reflects an excellent thermal stability property. The experimental results indicate that the PSU/SPEKEKK membrane has the potential to greatly enhance the efficiency of MFCs.","[Azhar, Masaud; Aziz, Madzlan] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Jaafar, Juhana] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Jaafar, Juhana] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Chem & Energy Engn, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Umar, Yunusa] Jubail Ind Coll, Dept Chem Engn, Jubail Ind City, Saudi Arabia; [Mazumder, Mohammad A.

An important parameter of the PV installation is the power (Watts) accumulated over sunlight retrieval. Considerable losses may arise from the conversion, where the efficiency is typically 15% to 23%, with the remainder becoming losses in the form of accumulated heat under the PV array or panel installations. PV heat dissipation is dependent on solar radiation, air convection and PV cell conduction. Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) has been applied as a greenhouse shading element, having the ability of enabling specified spectrum of light color penetration during electric accumulation. Furthermore, only light of wavelength between 400 and 700 nm (PAR) is absorbed by the greenhouse plants which is essential for their growth and photosynthesis. A Portable DSSC Mini Greenhouse (PDMG) can provide simple, effective and suitable light source for botanical drugs. Light which is associated with increasing temperature and heat is critical to be measured. A measurement of average heat gain flowing into a building through building envelope (OTTV- Overall Thermal Transfer Value) is a well-known method adopted in green building design. In this paper, the OTTV approach is applied to calculate heat transfer properties, from outdoor surroundings to the PDMG structure, giving justification of the PDMG thermal conditions.

It is essential to build efficient methanol electrooxidation reaction electrocatalysts for DMFCs to achieve their practical application in future energy storage and conversion. A catalyst consisting of nickel-palladium supported onto mesostructured silica nanoparticles (NiPd-MSN) was synthesized by the wet impregnation method, while MSN was synthesized using the sol-gel method. MSN act as a catalyst support and has very good characteristics for practical support due to its large surface area (>1000 m(2)/g) and good chemical and mechanical stability. The microstructure and catalytic activity of the electrocatalysts were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) theory, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and chronoamperometry (CA). XRD showed that the NiPd-MSN electrocatalysts had a high crystallinity of PdO and NiO, while FESEM displayed that NiPd was dispersed homogeneously onto the high surface area of MSN. In alkaline media, the catalytic activity toward the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) of NiPd-MSN demonstrated the highest, which was 657.03 mA mg(-1) more than the other electrocatalysts. After 3600 s of CA analysis at -0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the MOR mass activity of NiPd-MSN in alkaline media was retained at a higher mass activity of 190.8 mA mg(-1) while the other electrocatalyst was significantly lower than that. This electrocatalyst is a promising anode material toward MOR in alkaline media.","[Mansor, Muliani; Timmiati, Sharifah Najiha; Wong, Wai Yin; Mohd Zainoodin, Azran; Lim, Kean Long; Kamarudin, Siti Kartom] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Kamarudin, Siti Kartom] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Chem & Proc Engn, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia","Timmiati, SN (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",mulianimansor@yahoo.com; najiha@ukm.edu.my; waiyin.wong@ukm.edu.my; azrans@ukm.edu.my; kllim@ukm.edu.my; ctie@ukm.edu.my,"Lim, Kean Long/A-1809-2009","Lim, Kean Long/0000-0002-7227-5391; Wong, Wai Yin/0000-0002-5093-1431",Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE)Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR) [FRGS/1/2019/STG01/UKM/03/1],"This research was funded by research project code no.

In this study, a protective Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 carbonate (BSCF-SDCC) perovskite coating was developed on SUS 430 stainless steel through electrophoretic deposition and subsequently sintering to overcome these problems. BSCF-SDCC coating layer was sintered from 550 degrees C to 750 degrees C and examined in terms of its crystalline phase, carbonate bonding and microstructure. Area specific resistance (ASR) was tested at each sintering temperature of BSCF-SDCC coating by using a two-probe DC technique during oxidation at 600 degrees C. Afterwards, the microstructure was analyzed to ensure the endurance of coating characteristics and determine chromium diffusion during oxidation. Carbonate bonding in BSCF-SDCC decreased when sintering temperature increased. The microstructure of the BSCF-SDCC coating sintered at 550 degrees C-650 degrees C was uniform and dense, but a crack was observed in the coating sintered at 700 degrees C and 750 degrees C. The crystalline phase of BSCF-SDCC was verified except the coating sintered at 750 degrees C, indicating the secondary phase of BaCO3. After 500 h of oxidation, the BSCF-SDCC coating sintered at 550 degrees C-650 degrees C was achieved below the required 0.1 Omega cm(2), whereas the coating sintered at 600 degrees C exhibited the lowest ASR of 0.073 Omega cm(2). The coating microstructure remained dense, compact and uniform after thermal oxidation. Therefore, a protective BSCF-SDCC coating for interconnects was successfully developed at low temperatures (400 degrees C-600 degrees C).","[Tan, K. H.; Rahman, H.

The latter is dedicated to remote area applications. The system is a compound that utilizes renewable sources that are Wind Generator (WG), Solar Array (SA), Fuel Cell (FC) and Energy Storage System (ESS) using a battery. The power electronic converters play a very important role in the system; they optimize the control and energy management techniques of the various sources. For wind and solar subsystem, the speed and Single Input Fuzzy Logic (SIFL) controllers are used respectively to harvest the maximum power point tracking (MPPT). To maintain a balance of energy in the hybrid system, an energy management strategy based on the battery state of charge (SOC) has been developed and implemented experimentally. The AC output voltage regulation was achieved using a Proportional Integral (PI) controller to supply a resistive load with constant amplitude and frequency. According to the obtained performances, it was concluded that the proposed system is very promising for potential applications in hybrid renewable energy management systems.

A substantial improvement in the dimensional stability of OPBI film, either for the undoped or for the phosphoric acid doped membranes, with low content of DBSA (12.5 wt.%) was achieved. Moreover, the charge mobility in OPBI/DBSA films remained stable between 22 oC and 140 oC, for both doped and undoped states.

The synthesis, characterization and catalytic activities of four electrocatalysts, PtRu/CNC, PtNi/CNC, PtFe/CNC and PtCo/CNC, have been investigated. These electrocatalysts are synthesized using pyrolysis, followed by a microwave-assisted ethylene glycol reduction method. From X-ray diffraction analysis, PtNi/CNC and PtRu/CNC showed the smallest crystallite particle size of Pt-alloy, which corresponded to the (111) plane. The Raman spectra confirmed the presence of the carbon support material in all prepared electrocatalysts. The ratio value of the D band and G band (I-D/I-G) of all prepared samples was not much different within the electrocatalyst and CNC. TheI(D)/I(G)values calculated for the CNC, PtNi/CNC, PtRu/CNC, PtCo/CNC and PtFe/CNC electrocatalysts were 0.90, 0.89, 0.83, 0.78 and 0.77, respectively. Therefore, the number of defects of graphitization in increasing order (I-D/I-G) was PtFe/CNC < PtCo/CNC < PtRu/CNC < PtNi/CNC < CNC. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis revealed that the CNC support has a mesoporous-type structure with a high surface area of 416 m(2)g(-1), which indicates that this support has a high potential to act as an excellent catalyst support. From the cyclic voltammetry curve, PtRu/CNC showed the highest catalytic activity in methanol electro-oxidation and reached a value of 427 mA mg(-1), followed by PtNi/CNC (384.11 mA mg(-1)), PtCo/CNC (150.53 mA mg(-1)) and PtFe/CNC (144.11 mA mg(-1)). PtFe/CNC exhibited a higher ratio value ofI(f)/I-b(3.24) compared with PtRu/CNC (2.34), PtNi/CNC (1.43) and PtCo/CNC (1.62). These values show that the combination of Pt and Fe catalysts in PtFe/CNC had better CO tolerance than PtRu/CNC, PtNi/CNC and PtCo/CNC electrocatalysts. The higher performance of PtRu/CNC was attributed to the fact that it had the smallest bimetallic-Pt crystallite; there was a smooth distribution of bimetallic-Pt on its CNC support, as shown by field emission scanning electron microscopy; it had the highest electrochemical surface area value (16.23 m(2)g(-1)); and it had an overall catalytic performance enhanced by the advantages of the unique and large surface area from the CNC as support material. In passive DMFC mode, PtRu/CNC showed a maximum power density of 3.35 mW cm(-2), which is 1.72 times higher than that of the PtRu/C commercial electrocatalyst.","[Ramli, Zatil A. C.; Kamarudin, S.

Nevertheless, the use of Nafion membranes that operate only at low temperature (<100 degrees C) can lead to some disadvantages in PEMFC systems, such as a low impurity tolerance and slow kinetics. To overcome the above problems, this study introduces a highly durable composite membrane with an inorganic filler for a high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) applications under anhydrous conditions. In this work, polybenzimidazole (PBI) is used as a polymer electrolyte membrane with the addition of a sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO) inorganic filler. The amount of SGO filler was varied (0.5-6 wt.%) to study its influence on proton conductivity at elevated temperature, mechanical stability as well as phosphoric acid doping level. In particular, PBI-SGO composite membranes exhibited higher the level of acid dopant and proton conductivities than those of the pure PBI membranes. The PBI-SGO 2 wt.% composite membrane displayed the highest proton conductivity, with a value of 9.142 mS cm(-1) at 25 degrees C, and it increased to 29.30 mS cm(-1) at 150 degrees C. The PBI-SGO 2 wt.% also displayed the maximum values in the acid doping level (11.63 mol of PA/PBI repeat unit) and mechanical stability (48.86 MPa) analyses. In the HT-PEMFC test, compared with a pristine PBI membrane, the maximum power density was increased by 40% with the use of a PBI composite membrane with 2 wt.% SGO. These results show that the PBI-SGO membrane has a great potential to be applied as an alternative membrane in HT-PEMFC applications, offering the possibility of improving impurity tolerance and kinetic reactions.

The maximum power densities in biogas are 0.116, 0.211, 0.263, and 0.314 W/cm(2) for undoped Ni/ScSZ, undoped Ni/ScSZ with 3 wt% pore former, Sn-Ni/ScSZ and Sn-NiScSZ with 1 wt% pore former, respectively.

In the present study, the influence of microbial mutualistic interactions on the power generation of palm oil mill effluent fed MFCs has been widely investigated by designing several co-culture and mixed culture inoculums. Among the different inoculum compositions, the highest power density of 14.8 W/m(3) was achieved by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella variicola co-culture inoculum due to their synergistic relationships which were inter-linked via fermentation-based metabolites. Besides, the interaction of K. variicola and Bacillus cereus positively influenced the power generation resulting in a maximum power density of 11.8 W/m(3) whereas the antagonistic relationship between B. cereus and P. aeruginosa resulted in a lower power generation of 1.9 W/m(3). The microbial mutualistic interactions were investigated with polarization, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as well as by using metabolite and biofilm analysis. It was observed that the synergism between bacteria enhanced power generation through the production of higher electron shuttling mediators and efficient biofilm formation as evidenced by polarization, CV and EIS analysis. In contrast, the antagonistic relationship resulted in production of cell inhibiting metabolites leading to the formation of ineffective biofilm. These findings demonstrate that the synergistic interaction between or within microorganisms is emergent in designing co-culture or mixed-culture inoculum for achieving maximum power generation in MFCs.

This was the first attempt where activated carbon flakes were applied as cathode material in PFC. This study examined the influence of parameters such as light irradiation, cathode material, initial dye concentration, supporting electrolytes, pH and concentration of oxidizing agent and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on the efficiency of PFC to degrade azo dye of RR120 while generating electricity. Complete decolourization of up to 50 mg/L of RR120 dye was achieved but increased dye concentration significantly reduced the PFC efficiency.

However, several problems, such as methanol crossover and the cost of Nafion membranes, restrict the commercialisation of this technology. The main objective of this study was to produce a high-selectivity membrane from waste material. Following the current trend of 'waste-to-wealth', eggshell powder is selected as the filler in the Nafion matrix. The materials are analysed using physical and electrochemical characterisation. The composite membrane with a 3 wt% filler content resulted in the highest selectivity of 28.73 x 10(4) S s cm(-3), proton conductivity of 0.2414 S cm(-1)and methanol permeability of 8.40 x 10(-7)cm(2)s(-1). The single-cell performance test shows that the power density is 19.34 mW cm(-2)for the composite membrane and that it has comparable performance with a commercial Nafion 117 membrane. These results confirm the potential of eggshell powder to be incorporated as a filler in a Nafion matrix for applications in DMFC.","[Hamid, Nur S. A.; Kamarudin, S.

Two types of biofilm carriers were used to fill the MBBR: black plastic media (BPM) and Hexafilter (HEX). Three media filling fractions (MFFs: 25 %, 50 % and 70 %) and retention times (RTs: 24, 48 and 72 h) were investigated to achieve the best MBBR performance in terms of the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) from POME. Increasing the RT significantly improved the removal of COD and NH3-N, whereas increasing the MFF resulted in insignificant changes. Overall, HEX performed better than BPM at 50 % MFF (72 h RT). Metagenomics analysis identified approximately 13 phyla of bacteria on the HEX compared to the BPM with only 10 phyla. Based on these findings, the laboratory-scale MBBR deserved a vote as an alternative treatment for POME under appropriate RTs and MFFs and in the presence of a suitable microbial community.

Herein, the authors synthesized an ultrathin reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheet with similar to 47 nm via an improved Hummer's method. The TiO2 was deposited by RF sputtering onto an rGO nanosheet with a variation of temperature to enhance the photogenerated electron or charge carrier mobility transport for the photoanode component. The morphology, topologies, element composition, crystallinity as well as dye-sensitized solar cells' (DSSCs) performance were determined accordingly. Based on the results, FTIR spectra revealed presence of Ti-O-C bonds in every rGO-TiO2 nanocomposite samples at 800 cm(-1). Besides, XRD revealed that a broad peak of anatase TiO2 was detected at similar to 25.4 degrees after incorporation with the rGO. Furthermore, it was discovered that sputtering temperature of 120 degrees C created a desired power conversion energy (PCE) of 7.27% based on the J-V plot. Further increase of the sputtering temperature to 160 degrees C and 200 degrees C led to excessive TiO2 growth on the rGO nanosheet, thus resulting in undesirable charge recombination formed at the photoanode in the DSSC device.","[Low, Foo Wah] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Low, Foo Wah; Chin Hock, Goh; Samsudin, Nurul Asma; Aminul Islam, Mohammad; Amin, Nowshad; Tiong, Sieh Kiong] Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Sustainable Energy, Energy Univ, Jalan IKRAM UNITEN, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Kashif, Muhammad] Tianjin Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Chau, Chien Fat] Univ Tenaga Nas, Coll Engn, Energy Univ, Jalan IKRAM UNITEN, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Indah Utami, Amaliyah Rohsari] Telkom Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Engn Phys, Bandung 40257, Indonesia; [Aminul Islam, Mohammad] Univ Malaya, Dept Elect Engn, Jalan Univ, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Selangor, Malaysia; [Heah, Cheng Yong] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Fac Engn Technol, Kangar 02100, Perlis, Malaysia; [Heah, Cheng Yong; Liew, Yun Ming] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Mat Engn, Ctr Excellence Geopolymer & Green Technol CeGeoG, Kangar 01000, Perlis, Malaysia; [Lai, Chin Wei] Univ Malaya UM, Inst Adv Studies IAS, Nanotechnol & Catalysis Res Ctr NANOCAT, Level 3,Block A, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Selangor, Malaysia","Low, FW (corresponding author), Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia.; Low, FW; Hock, GC (corresponding author), Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Sustainable Energy, Energy Univ, Jalan IKRAM UNITEN, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia.; Chau, CF (corresponding author), Univ Tenaga Nas, Coll Engn, Energy Univ, Jalan IKRAM UNITEN, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia.",lowfw@utar.edu.my; chinhock@uniten.edu.my; kashiff.farooq@gmail.com; nurul.asma@uniten.edu.my; chinhock@uniten.edu.my; amaliyahriu@telkomuniversity.ac.id; aminbgm@gmail.com; cyheah@unimap.edu.my; ymliew@unimap.edu.my; cwlai@um.edu.my; nowshad@uniten.edu.my; siehkiong@uniten.edu.my,"Utami, Amaliyah R.I./AAB-6411-2021; Lai, Chin Wei/E-7062-2013; Low, Foo Wah/B-3654-2016","Utami, Amaliyah R.I./0000-0002-3077-2285; Lai, Chin Wei/0000-0002-7549-5015; Low, Foo Wah/0000-0003-2551-7623",Uniten-Telkom University Grant [2020102TELCO]; BOLD2025 Grant [RJO10517844/090]; Internal Research Grant Opex under Universiti Tenaga Nasional Sdn.

After collecting sample, oil was extracted using the Soxhlet extraction method. Spirogyra oil was characterized physico-chemically for the evaluation of its quality. Acid value, density, saponification value, peroxide value, as well as viscosity and iodine values were determined and their values were 16.67 +/- 3.53 mg KOH/g, 0.859 +/- 0.050 g/cm(3), 165.33 +/- 13.20 mg KOH/g, 4.633 +/- 0.252 meq/kg, 5.63 +/- 0.833 mm(2)/mL, and 117.67 +/- 13.01 mg I-2/g, respectively.

In this aspect, the contribution of the medium or electrolyte properties in the PFC system such as dye concentration, ionic nature and active radicals play a decisive role. Herein, we constructed a PFC with ZnO loaded nickel foam (ZnO/Ni) photoanode to study the influence of initial dye concentration, pH and supporting electrolytes of different polyatomic anions on the PFC performance. The optimum initial dye concentration and pH for the PFC with reactive red 120 as organic pollutants were found to be 30 mg L-1 and 7.5, respectively. The PFC performance can be synergistically enhanced by the addition of three types of polyatomic anions (Na3PO4, Na2SO4 and NaNO3) as supporting electrolytes. In turn, PO43- had the greatest influence on the reduction of internal resistance (highest short circuit current, J(sc)) which corresponded to the conductivity of dye solution. Eventually, the higher charge of polyatomic ions could contribute to higher energy conversion efficiency in PFC.

Morphological investigations reveal the existence of SnO2 nanocubes on sheet-like structure of sBH and the uniform dispersion of above composite on SPEEK matrix. The layered sheet-like structure of BH act as heat diffusion barrier and the ceramic feature of SnO2 further improves the thermal stability of a SPEEK membrane. The exposed large surface area of BH and tightly bound water molecules in SnO2 and -SO3H sites increase the water retention properties, which consequently enhance the ionic conductivity of SPEEK/sBH/SnO2 composite membrane. Furthermore, the high aspect ratio of sBH and methanol resistive characteristic of SnO2 lower the methanol diffusion channels in the sBH/SnO2 composite membrane. With the coalition of above significant electrochemical properties, SPEEK/sBH/SnO2 solid electrolyte demonstrates the high DMFC power density and excellent durability, which showers light on the viability of prepared membrane in high performance and durable DMFCs.","[Ranjani, M.; Kumar, G.

Due to intermittency of solar energy, traditional batteries are used to store energy. However, batteries have several drawbacks such as limited lifespan, low storage capacity, uncontrolled discharge when not connected to a load and limited number of charge/discharge cycles. In this paper, the feasibility of using hydrogen as a battery is analyzed where hydrogen is produced by the extra diurnal generated electricity by a rooftop household solar power generation unit and utilized in a fuel cell system to generate the required electrical power at night. In the proposed design, two rooftop concentrated photovoltaic thermal (CPVT) systems coupled with an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) are used to generate electricity during 9.5 h per day and the extra power is utilized in an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen. Various working fluids (Isobutane, R134a, R245fa and R123) are used in the ORC system to analyze the maximum feasible power generation by this section. Under the operating conditions, the generated power by ORC as well as its efficiency are evaluated for various working fluids and the most efficient working fluid is selected. The required power for the compressor in the hydrogen storage process is calculated and the number of electrolyzer cells required for the hydrogen production system is determined. The results indicate that the hybrid CPVT-ORC system produces 2.378 kW of electricity at 160 suns. Supplying 65% of the produced electricity to an electrolyzer, 0.2606 kg of hydrogen is produced and stored for nightly use in a fuel cell system. This amount of hydrogen can generate the required electrical power at night while the efficiency of electrolyzer is more than 70%. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The DLHF co-sintered at 1450 degrees C was chosen as optimum temperature due to the good mechanical strength and gas-tight property. Meanwhile, 18 to 34 mu m of electrolyte thickness was achieved when electrolyte extrusion rate increase from 1 to 5 mL min(-1). Power density as high as 0.32 W cm(-2)was obtained on the cell with the electrolyte layer of 18 mu m in thickness (DLHF1) which is 20% higher than the cell with an electrolyte layer of 34 mu m (DLHF5) which was only 0.12 W cm(-2)when operated at 850 degrees C. However, DLHF1 had suffered cracking formation that originated from anode site which shortened the stability test duration to only 8 hours of survival under 750 degrees C. While DLHF5 can operate up to 15 hours but an increase in electrolyte thickness had resulted in higher ohmic area-specific resistance that lowering the power density. Fifty-seven percent reduction in cell performance was observed under methane condition when compared to the cell that performs using hydrogen gas due to the carbon deposition as proven by Raman spectroscopy and carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur analyzer.","[Ab Rahman, Mazlinda; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan; Omar, Ahmad F.; Shabri, Hazrul A.; Deraman, Shahirah; A.

Among various metallic interconnects, the ferritic interconnects are the most promising. However, chromium poisoning in them adversely affects their performance. To resolve this issue, various coatings and pretreatment methods have been studied. Herein, this article encloses the coating of CuFe(2)O(4)spinel over two prominent ferritic interconnects (Crofer 22 APU and SUS 430). The CuFe(2)O(4)spinel layer coating has been developed by the dip-coating of both samples in CuFe(2)O(4)slurry, followed by heat treatment at 800 degrees C in a reducing environment (5% hydrogen and 95% nitrogen). Additionally, both samples were annealed to further enhance their spinel coating structure. The morphological and crystallinity analysis confirmed that the spinel coating formed multiple layers of protection while annealing further reduced the thickness and improved the densities. Moreover, the area-specific resistance (ASR) and weight gain rate (WGR) of both samples before and after annealing was calculated using mathematical modeling, which matches with the experimental data. It has been noted that CuFe(2)O(4)spinel coating improved the ASR and WGR of both samples which were further improved after annealing. This research reveals that the CuFe(2)O(4)spinel is the promising protective layer for ferritic interconnects and annealing is the better processing technique for achieving the preferred properties.","[Hassan, Muhammad Aqib; Bin Mamat, Othman] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Mech Engn, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak Darul Rid, Malaysia","Hassan, MA (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Mech Engn, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak Darul Rid, Malaysia.",aqibhassan71@gmail.com; drothman_mamat@utp.edu.my,,"Hassan, Muhammad Aqib/0000-0002-6647-6891",Yayasan Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (YUTP) [015LC0-255],The authors would like to thank Yayasan Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (YUTP) for funding the project under the cost center 015LC0-255.,,54,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,SEP,2020,8,9,,,,,,,1113,10.3390/pr8091113,,,14,"Engineering, Chemical",Engineering,OD9LG,WOS:000580165200001,,DOAJ Gold,,,1/2/2021,

In this study, a novel blended membrane based on SPEEK at higher degrees of sulfonation (DS) of 80% and epoxidized natural rubber (ENR-50) are prepared at different mass ratio of SPEEK to ENR-50 (9.5:0.5, 9.0:1.0, 8.5:1.5, 8.0:2.0, and 7.5:2.5) via solution intercalation method. The influence of ENR-50 loading on the physical properties of SPEEK blends membranes was investigated and compared with the pristine SPEEK and Nafion117 membranes. The blended membranes were characterized by FTIR, which showed a successful chemical interaction between ENR-50 and SPEEK matrix. SEM images revealed a uniform dispersion of ENR-50 droplets in the polymer structure. The water uptake and methanol permeability of SPE50 membrane were found to be decreased with increasing of ENR-50 content. The highest proton conductivity of SPE50 membrane obtained was 47% higher than pure SPEEK, whereas the lowest permeability value obtained was 21 times lower than Nafion117 membrane. Consequently, incorporation of ENR-50 into SPEEK matrix has substantially enhanced the selectivity of the membrane by five folds. Apparently, this newly developed SPE blend membrane can be listed as one of the potential proton electrolyte membranes for the usage in DMFCs. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Azman, W.

However, the production of biofuel from microalgae biomass consists of several steps, of which lipid extraction is the most important one. Because of the nature of feedstock, extraction needs special attention. Three different methods were studied to extract algal oil from two different algae variant,Chlorellasp. andSpirulinasp. The highest percentage oil yield was obtained by ultrasonication (9.4% forChlorellasp., 6.6% forSpirulinasp.) followed by the Soxhlet and solvent extraction processes. Ultrasonication and Soxhlet extraction processes were further optimized to maximize oil extraction as solvent extraction was not effective in extracting lipid. For ultrasonication, an amplitude of 90% recorded the highest percentage yield of oil forSpirulinasp. and a 70% amplitude recorded the highest percentage yield of oil forChlorellasp. On the other hand, for Soxhlet extraction, a combination of chloroform, hexane, and methanol at a 1:1:1 ratio resulted in the highest yield of algal oil. Afterward, the crude algae oil from the ultrasonication process was transesterified for 5 h using an immobilized lipase (Novozyme 435) at 40 degrees C to convert triglycerides into fatty acid methyl ester and glycerol. Thus, ultrasonic-assisted lipid extraction was successful in producing biodiesel from both the species.","[Fattah, I. M. Rizwanul; Mofijur, M.; Ong, Hwai Chyuan; Mahlia, T.

Cancer-cell invasion dynamically begins with the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) via invadopodia formation. The chemical substrates that are utilized by hypoxic cells as fuel to drive invadopodia formation are still not fully understood. Therefore, the aim of the study was to maintain MDA-MB-231 cells under hypoxia conditions to allow cells to form a large number of invadopodia as a model, followed by identifying their nutrient utilization. The results of the study revealed an increase in the number of cells forming invadopodia under hypoxia conditions. Moreover, Western blot analysis confirmed that essential proteins for hypoxia and invadopodia, including HIF-1 alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), metallopeptidase-2 (MMP-2), and Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 7 (beta-PIX), significantly increased under hypoxia. Interestingly, phenotype microarray showed that only 11 chemical substrates from 367 types of substrates were significantly metabolized in hypoxia compared to in normoxia. This is thought to be fuel for hypoxia to drive the invasion process. In conclusion, we found 11 chemical substrates that could have potential energy sources for hypoxia-induced invadopodia formation of these cells. This may in part be a target in the hypoxic tumor and invadopodia formation. Additionally, these findings can be used as potential carrier targets in cancer-drug discovery, such as the usage of dextrin.","[Hamad, Hamad Ali; Alrawas, Anmar; Zakuan, Noraina Muhamad; Abdullah, Nurul Akmaryanti; Cheah, Yoke Kqueen; Hashim, Nur Fariesha Md] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Biomed Sci, Serdang 43300, Malaysia; [Hamad, Hamad Ali] Anbar Canc Ctr, Res & Training Unit, Anbar Hlth Directorate, Ramadi 31001, Iraq; [Enezei, Hamid Hammad] Anbar Univ, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Coll Dent, Ramadi 31001, Iraq","Zakuan, NM; Hashim, NFM (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Biomed Sci, Serdang 43300, Malaysia.",hamadali91.ha@gmail.com; drhamed2000@yahoo.com; anmar.alrawas@gmail.com; noraina@upm.edu.my; nurulakmar@upm.edu.my; ykcheah@upm.edu.my; nurfariesha@upm.edu.my,,"Cheah, Yoke Kqueen/0000-0001-9258-3749; ABDULLAH, NURUL AKMARYANTI/0000-0001-5161-9194",Universiti Putra Malaysia [GP-IPM/2016/7470300],The research was funded by Universiti Putra Malaysia (grant number GP-IPM/2016/7470300).,,45,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1420-3049,,MOLECULES,Molecules,SEP,2020,25,17,,,,,,,3876,10.3390/molecules25173876,,,17,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,NO6OE,WOS:000569608100001,32858793,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,1/2/2021,

Here, a defect rich nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene/iron carbide (NS-GR/Fe3C) nanocomposite as an electrocatalyst for ORR and OER is demonstrated. An ink of NS-GR/Fe3C is developed by homogeneously dispersing the catalyst in a Nafion containing solvent mixture using an ultrasonication bath (Model-DC150H; power - 150 W; frequency - 40 kHz). The ultrasonically prepared ink is used for preparing the electrode for electrochemical studies. In the case of ORR, the positive half-wave potential displayed by NS-GR/Fe3C is 0.859 V (vs. RHE) and for the OER, onset potential is 1.489 V (vs. RHE) with enhanced current density. The optimized NS-GRFe(3)C electrode exhibited excellent ORR/OER bifunctional activities, high methanol tolerance and excellent long-term cycling stability in an alkaline medium. The observed onset potential for NS-GR/Fe3C electrocatalyst is comparable with the commercial noble metal catalyst, thereby revealing one of the best low-cost alternative air-cathode catalysts for the energy conversion and storage application.","[Rani, Karuppasamy Kohila; Wang, Sea-Fue; Sireesha, Pedaballi; Devasenathipathy, Rajkumar] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Mat & Mineral Resources Engn, 1,Sect 3,Chung Hsiao East Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Karuppiah, Chelladurai; Yang, Chun-Chen] Ming Chi Univ Technol, Battery Res Ctr Green Energy, New Taipei 24301, Taiwan; [Alaswad, Saleh O.] King Abdulaziz City Sci & Technol KACST, Nucl Sci Res Inst NSRI, POB 6086, Riyadh 11442, Saudi Arabia; [Jose, Rajan] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Ind Sci & Technol, Nanostruct Renewable Energy Mat Lab, Kuantan 26300, Malaysia; [Yang, Chun-Chen] Ming Chi Univ Technol, Dept Chem Engn, New Taipei 24301, Taiwan; [Yang, Chun-Chen] Chang Gung Univ, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan","Wang, SF (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Mat & Mineral Resources Engn, 1,Sect 3,Chung Hsiao East Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.; Karuppiah, C; Yang, CC (corresponding author), Ming Chi Univ Technol, Battery Res Ctr Green Energy, New Taipei 24301, Taiwan.",chella1986@mail.mcut.edu.tw; sfwang@ntut.edu.tw; ccyang@mail.mcut.edu.tw,"KARUPPIAH, CHELLADURAI/H-7068-2019; Jose, Rajan/C-9944-2009","KARUPPIAH, CHELLADURAI/0000-0003-0811-2376; Jose, Rajan/0000-0003-4540-321X","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 109-3116-F-131-001-CC1]","Financial support from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan (Project No: MOST 109-3116-F-131-001-CC1) is gratefully acknowledged.

Aiming to alleviate these issues, in this study, the anode with different configurations for DEFC was designed and fabricated with different catalyst layer (CL) and microporous layer (MPL) arrangements. The four types of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is named with MEA-1 (with pretreated carbon paper (PCP) and PtCL), MEA-2 (with PCP, MPL and PtCL), MEA-3 (with PCP, MPL, PtCL and PdCL) and MEA-4 (with PCP, MPL, PtCL, MPL and PdCL). The performance, stability and ethanol crossover of MEAs were tested and measured for continuous long-term operation for 120 h, while the morphological characterization was analyzed. Based on the results, power density for each MEA decreased with time, while ethanol crossover increased gradually. The MEA-3 with additional PdCL shows a highest performance and stability about 20 W/m(2), and has a lowest ethanol crossover's magnitude. The highest ethanol crossover was obtained using MEA-1 at 3.7 mg/m(2).s. Higher ethanol crossover had caused low stability of DEFC performance which result higher irreversible degradation. Moreover, based on characterization, elemental mapping and EDX illustrated phenomena of membrane swelling, delamination of electrode from membrane, and CL loss after stability test for 5 days for all MEAs. The significance of anode structure design was proven in this current study. The anode design of double-layered CL has potential to use at anode structure to reduce ethanol crossover rate, thereby improving DEFC performance and stability.

However, the high cost of Nafion membrane and other drawbacks like high methanol crossover hinder the advancement of this industry. This study aims to develop a low cost membrane using sulfonated poly ether ether ketone (SPEEK) polymer. Silica and silicotungstic acid (SiWA) were incorporated into the membrane matrix using solution casting method. The optimum loading of the additives was tuned and it is discovered that the SPEEK membrane containing 10 wt% of silica and 5 wt% of SiWA has the best performance due to its high proton conductivity and moderately low methanol permeability. The performance of the membrane can further be enhanced by adding (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) as coupling agents. Inclusion of APTES and CDI in SPEEK could not only improve the compatibility between organic SPEEK and inorganic additives, but also improve the homogeneity and dispersity of the additives. As a result, the resultant membrane with a better dimensional stability achieves high selectivity (10.60 x 10(4) S.s/cm(3)) up to 6.5 times more than pristine SPEEK membrane and 1.3 times higher than the commercial Nafion 117 membrane.

The microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology with the capability to convert environmental waste to energy can be improved with cheap ceramic material. The ceramic is structurally porous, thus allow a direct exchange of cation. The ceramic material also enhances stability thermally and chemically, non-ion selective characteristic, high mechanical strength, and easily washable. Commercially produced ceramic structures have been proven to reduce Chemical Oxygen Demand up to 92% and allow high power output. It is also comparatively durable in the long-term operation of MFC, compared to the commercially available membrane. The novelty of using tubular design is the efficient use of space, which leads to the possibility of scaling up. As a conclusion, a combination of both ceramic material and tubular design could be an excellent alternative separator for MFC. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Neodymium (Nd) was doped into CGO in four different weight ratios in the formula NdxGd0.15Ce0.85-xO2-delta (NGCO); the selected percentages for x were 1%, 3%, 5% and 7%. XRD patterns showed pure phase for all synthesized compositions and good compatibility at high temperature under static air with the most common ceramic cathode material in IT-SOFC (La0.60Sr0.40Co0.20Fe0.80O2-a, LSCF). Impedance spectroscopic characterization of symmetrical cells of the composite NGCO-LSCF at different temperatures (650-800 degrees C in steps of 50 degrees C) and a frequency range of 0.1-1 MHz in synthetic air revealed interesting results. The lowest polarization resistance (R-p) was achieved for NdxGd0.15Ce0.85-xO2-delta (0.06 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C, 0.17 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C, 0.31 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C, and 0.59 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C). The expected decrease in R-p was not observed for the sample with higher Nd content (7% Nd). Thus, it can be said that there is a distinction between the compositions NdxGd0.15Ce0.85-xO2-delta and Nd0.07Gd0.15Ce0.78O2-delta; the co-doping of Nd in NGCO incremented the oxygen ion diffusion path, thereby optimization in the triple phase boundary (TPB) sites was obtained. Furthermore, SEM and TGA measurements were conducted to clarify the reasons of such improvements. This work showed that an NGCO-LSCF composite can be considered as a potential candidate for cathode material for future IT-SOFC applications. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Moreover, these materials are currently utilized in low-temperature proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Various dopants, such as Mn, Sr, and Zn, are introduced into LiCo2-based materials to improve their properties and performance for proton-conducting SOFC applications. In this regard, Mn-, Sr-, and Zn-doped LiCoO2 and LiCo0.6X0.4O2 (X = Mn, Sr, or Zn) powders are synthesized via the glycine-nitrate combustion method. Their properties are characterized using different techniques. The precursor cathode powder is dried at 100 degrees C and subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The phase formation and morphology of calcined LiCo0.6Mn0.4O2 (LCMO), LiCo0.6Sr0.4O2 (LCSO), and LiCo0.6Zn0.4O2 (LCZO) powders at 600 degrees C to 700 degrees C are examined via X-ray diffraction. At 600 degrees C, both calcined LCSO and LCZO powders show few secondary phases, but these phases greatly decrease as calcination temperature increases to 700 degrees C. By contrast, calcined LCMO powders exhibit a single phase structure at both calcination temperatures of 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C. The measured crystallite sizes of LCMO, LCSO, and LCZO powders are 23.32 +/- 0.20, 21.08 +/- 0.72, and 21.24 +/- 0.32 nm, respectively. TEM images indicate that the particles in LCMO and LCZO powders highly agglomerate compared with those in LCZO powders. This result confirms that LCSO cathodes have the highest electrical conductivity (356.66 S cm(-1)) and the lowest area specific resistance (0.29 Omega cm(2) in humidified [3%] air) at 700 degrees C. In conclusion, LCSO materials are the best cathodes with high potential for proton-conducting SOFC applications.","[Wan Yusoff, Wan Nor Anasuhah; Somalu, Mahendra Rao; Baharuddin, Nurul Akidah; Muchtar, Andanastuti] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi, Malaysia; [Muchtar, Andanastuti] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Mech & Mfg Engn, Bangi, Malaysia; [Wei, Lai Jian] Orbiting Sci & Technol Sdn Bhd, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Somalu, MR (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",mahen@ukm.edu.my,,"Somalu, Mahendra Rao/0000-0003-1667-693X",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia [DIP-2018-013],"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Grant/Award Number: DIP-2018-013",,37,0,0,17,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0363-907X,1099-114X,,INT J ENERG RES,Int.

A simplified fabrication technique of phase inversion-based co-extrusion/co-sintering has yielded a perfectly bounded sandwich structure with free-delamination and defect layers. The effect of co-sintering temperatures (1300 degrees C-1450 degrees C) on the morphologies, elemental distributions, electrolyte gas-tightness, mechanical strength, electrochemical performance and the impedance spectra test are well-inspected. The increase of co-sintering temperature has significant effects on the anode finger-like micro-channels shrinkage where the voids become very sharp-thin structure; and developing a thin gas-tight electrolyte layer.

It is shown that the proposed compensator can effectively reduce the harmonic contents in voltage and current without any dependence on offset devices such as active and passive filters.

On one hand, renewable energies have turned to the first choice of system operators. On the other hand, the system should provide the required infrastructure to appropriately accommodate such energy sources. In this respect, microgrids (MG) would provide the needed conditions for integrating renewable energy sources (RESs). Thus, the optimal energy management of such systems in the presence of highly uncertain renewable power generation is of great importance. Accordingly, this paper provides a stochastic programming framework for the optimal scheduling of an MG equipped with RESs and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The power sources considered include a wind energy system in the form of wind turbine (WT), a solar photovoltaic (PV) system, a fuel cell (FC), a microturbine (MT), besides a battery storage system (BSS). The mentioned problem is formulated as a single-objective optimization problem aimed at minimizing the total operating cost over the scheduling period. The MG is considered in the grid-connected mode where it can transact power with the upstream system. The uncertainty of the problem is due to the intermittent power output of the wind energy system and the PV unit, as well as uncertain behavior of the EV owners in charging/discharging their vehicles. The proposed stochastic optimization problem is the solved using an effective and efficient optimization algorithm named modified harmony search (MHS) algorithm. Finally, the simulation results are discussed and the superior performance of the suggested algorithm is verified through making a comprehensive comparison with some well-known methods.","[Liu, Chanjuan] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Abdulkareem, Sarkew S.] Univ Halabja, Coll Sci, Dept Phys, Halabja, Iraq; [Rezvani, Alireza] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Rezvani, Alireza] Duy Tan Univ, Fac Elect Elect Engn, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Samad, Sarminah] Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman Univ, Coll Business & Adm, Dept Business Adm, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Aljojo, Nahla] Univ Jeddah, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Dept Informat Syst & Technol, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Foong, Loke Kok] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Nishihara, Kentaro] Renewable Energy Inst, Tokyo, Japan","Rezvani, A (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.; Rezvani, A (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Fac Elect Elect Engn, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.",alirezarezvani@duytan.edu.vn,"Aljojo, Nahla/I-1380-2014","Aljojo, Nahla/0000-0003-2501-8533",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61702075]; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST [2018QNRC001]; Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman UniversityPrincess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University,"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61702075), the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (No. 2018QNRC001).

These intriguing properties render 2D/2D nanostructures highly auspicious in a multitude of photocatalytic energy applications, including water splitting for H-2 oxygen (O-2) evolution, reduction of CO2, and N-2 fixation. As such, this leads to the development of clean energy technology by 2D/2D catalysts and solar energy as the inexhaustible energy resource. Herein, the fundamental principles of 2D/2D hybrid heterostructures and diverse types of interfaces with different material families are systematically discussed. Furthermore, photocatalytic energy applications using 2D/2D heterointerfaces over the recent years are highlighted. Insights into the interplay of 2D/2D heterojunction interfaces and the associated physicochemical properties (e.g., charge carrier dynamics) toward the photocatalytic enhancement are put forward. Last but not least, the challenges and prospects in engineering 2D/2D heterostructure photocatalysts for affordable and clean energy advancements are reviewed, which serve as a guiding star not only in photocatalysis, but also in other applications in the energy realm such as fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, and photovoltaics.","[Ong, Wee-Jun] Xiamen Univ Malaysia, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, Sepang 43900, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Ong, Wee-Jun] Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Shak, Katrina Pui Yee] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Chem Engn, Kajang 43000, Selangor Darul, Malaysia","Ong, WJ (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ Malaysia, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, Sepang 43900, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.; Ong, WJ (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.; Shak, KPY (corresponding author), Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Chem Engn, Kajang 43000, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",weejun.ong@xmu.edu.my; shakpy@utar.edu.my,"Ong, Wee-Jun/O-1403-2013","Ong, Wee-Jun/0000-0002-5124-1934",Xiamen University Malaysia; Xiamen University Malaysia Research Fund [XMUMRF/2019-C3/IENG/0013]; Petronas; ExxonMobil; Shell Malaysia,"W.J.O. acknowledges financial assistance and faculty startup grants/supports from Xiamen University Malaysia.

Accordingly, we investigate the bioelectricity generation of a freshwater green alga strain from Japan, Chlorella vulgaris (NIES-642), using carbon paper and indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrodes. The ITO equipped BPV demonstrates the maximum power output of 0.25 mW m(-2), which is remarkably higher than carbon-paper-based BPV (0.21 mW m(-2),). The surface potential studies were conducted to understand the electron transfer at the interface of algal biofilm and electrodes using the Kelvin probe method. The minimal surface potential difference (0.2 V) observed for ITO compared to those of other processed electrodes demonstrates the maximum BPV power generation, owing to its lower electrical resistivity and higher electron donor/acceptor capacity.","[Ng, Fong-Lee; Phang, Siew-Moi; Thong, Cheng-Han] Univ Malaya, Inst Adv Studies Bldg, Inst Ocean & Earth Sci IOES, C308, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Phang, Siew-Moi] UCSI Univ, Fac Appl Sci, Kuala Lumpur 56000, Malaysia; [Iwamoto, Mitsumasa; Manaka, Takaaki; Shimosawa, Keito] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Tokyo 1528550, Japan; [Thong, Cheng-Han] Univ Malaya, Inst Adv Studies, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Periasamy, Vengadesh] Univ Malaya, Low Dimens Mat Res Ctr LDMRC, Dept Phys, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Kumar, G.

Hydrogen is one of the most popular clean and renewable fuels, which has widely been addressed by researchers in different contexts from additive fuel of internal combustion engines to pure feed of fuel cells. Hydrogen production is also one of the most interesting fields of study and extensive effort has been devoted to finding high-performance, fast, and economical approaches in this field. In this study, a novel high-temperature steam electrolyser system with an integrated solar Brayton cycle core is proposed and numerically simulated for hydrogen production. Energy and exergy analyses were carried out to gain better perception of the performance of the system and Rankine and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) were integrated with the main core to improve its efficiency. The influences of different parameters such as turbine inlet temperature, inlet heat flux from the sun, and compression ratio as well as the used organic fluid were investigated based on the first and second laws. Results showed the high performance of the proposed system with more than 98% energy efficiency in hydrogen production besides its simplicity of use. The highest exergy destruction occurred when the power generation system absorbed sun heat flux (more than 54%) and the performance of the system could be enhanced by improving the heat absorbing technology.

To determine its structure and properties, the nitrogen-doped graphene was characterized using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray ESEA/I-EDX), RAIVIAN Spectroscopy and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Based on FESEM-EDX analysis, the doped composite exhibited nitrogen content of similar to 3.5%. The nitrogen-doped graphene was examined as a replacement for platinum catalysts in fuel cells. Different composite catalysts were evaluated using a Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) to test the Oxidation Reduction Reaction (ORR) performance. Based on ORR performance comparison, the composite with highest performance was then used to fabricate a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA). Testing on MEA performance was conducted on a Fuel Cell Station, where Open Circuit Voltage (V-oc) of 0.14 V was obtained. The results indicate that the ball milling method may produce an efficient nitrogen-doped graphene MEA electrode from graphite and melamine only.

QPVA/GO nanocomposite membranes provide desirable properties such as low fuel uptake and permeability, excellent ionic conductivity, and cell performance, all of which are favorable for AEMs based on our previous works. Passive direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are recognized as suitable technologies for use in portable devices. Nevertheless, the commercialization of DMFCs remains restricted due to a number of issues related to the conventional membrane; one of these issues is high fuel crossover problems due to high fuel uptake and permeability of Nafion membrane. This study aimed to expand the potential applications of QPVA/GO nanocomposite membranes in air-breathing passive DMFCs. The ionic conductivity, methanol uptakes (MUs), and permeabilities of self-synthesis QPVA/GO nanocomposites are examined to evaluate the ability to operate in methanol atmosphere. At 30 degrees C, the ionic conductivity of the membranes reached 1.74 x 10(-2)S cm(-1). The MUs and permeabilities were as low as 35% and 7.6 x 10(-7)cm(2)s(-1), respectively. The performance of air-breathing passive DMFCs bearing QPVA/GO nanocomposite membrane is much higher compared to conventional membranes. The maximum power density of air-breathing passive DMFCs was achieved 27.2 mW cm(-2)under the optimum condition of 2 M methanol + 4 M KOH at 70 degrees C. Single-cells could be sustained for 1000 hours. This article is the first to optimize and highlight the performance air-breathing passive DMFCs by using a QPVA-based membrane.","[Zakaria, Zulfirdaus; Kamarudin, Siti Kartom] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Kamarudin, Siti Kartom] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Res Ctr Sustainable Proc Technol CESPRO, Bangi, Malaysia","Zakaria, Z; Kamarudin, SK (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",zulfirdaus@ukm.edu.my; ctie@ukm.edu.my,"Zakaria, Zulfirdaus/N-7641-2018","Zakaria, Zulfirdaus/0000-0003-3292-8009",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia [MI-2019-023],"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Grant/Award Number: MI-2019-023",,83,0,0,9,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0363-907X,1099-114X,,INT J ENERG RES,Int.

Microalgae have several merits, including their nontoxic nature, fast growth rate, growth not being dependent on the supply of fresh water, potential for biodegradability, and not requiring arable land for their growth. The exploration of novel frontiers to establish large-scale operations is vital for economically feasible biodiesel production, taking advantage of these favorable attributes. This review is focused on the recent development of the enzymatic transformation of microalgal oils into biodiesel. The areas addressed in this work include (i) microalgae and their lipid content, (ii) maximization of lipid productivity and lipid extraction, (iii) biodiesel production by enzymatic transesterification, (iv) enzyme kinetics, (v) factors affecting enzymatic transesterification, and (vi) immobilized enzymes and their limitations. In addition, various aspects of free enzyme and its potential future applications are discussed. This review also highlights a number of strategies using ionic liquids (ILs) for the successful production of microalgal biodiesel. The present study suggests that free enzyme has a greater potential than immobilized enzyme for the transesterification of bio-oils containing phospholipids into biodiesel.","[Razzak, Shaikh A.; Hossain, Mohammad M.] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Chem Engn, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia; [Hossain, S.

An innovative hybrid system, constructed wetland-microbial fuel cell (CW-MFC) was developed for simultaneous azo dye remediation and energy recovery. This study investigated the effect of circuit connection and the influence of azo dye molecular structures on the degradation rate of azo dye and bioelectricity generation. The closed circuit system exhibited higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and decolourisation efficiencies compared to the open circuit system. The wastewater treatment performances of different operating systems were ranked in the decreasing order of CW-MFC (R1 planted-closed circuit) > MFC (R2 plant-free-closed circuit) > CW (R1 planted-open circuit) > bioreactor (R2 plant-free-open circuit). The highest decolourisation rate was achieved by Acid Red 18 (AR18), 96%, followed by Acid Orange 7 (AO7), 67% and Congo Red (CR), 60%. The voltage outputs of the three azo dyes were ranked in the decreasing order of AR18 > AO7 > CR. The results disclosed that the decolourisation performance was significantly influenced by the azo dye structure and the moieties at the proximity of azo bond; the naphthol type azo dye with a lower number of azo bond and more electron-withdrawing groups could cause azo bond to be more electrophilic and more reductive for decolourisation. Moreover, the degradation pathway of AR18, AO7 and CR were elucidated based on the respective dye intermediate products identified through UV-Vis spectrophotometry, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analyses. The CW-MFC system demonstrated high capability of decolouring azo dyes at the anaerobic anodic region and further mineralising dye intermediates at the aerobic cathodic region to less harmful or non-toxic products.

Troger's base polymers (Tb-polymers) are recognized as promising membrane materials to overcome these obstacles. Herein, the AEMs made from Tbpoly(crown ether)s (Tb-PCEs) show good comprehensive performance. The influence of crown ether on the conductivity and alkaline stability of AEMs has been investigated in detail. The formation of hydronium ion-crown ether complexes and an obvious microphase-separated structure formed by the existence of crown ether can enhance the conductivity of the AEMs. The maximum OH- conductivity of 141.5 mS cm(-1) is achieved from the Tb-PCEs based AEM (Tb-PCE-1) at 80 degrees C in ultrapure water. The ion-dipole interaction of the Na+ with crown ether can protect the quaternary ammonium from the attack of OH- to improve the alkaline stability of AEMs. After 675 h of alkaline treatment, the OH - conductivity of Tb-PCE-1 decreases by only 6%. The TbPCE-1-based single cell shows a peak power density of 0.202 W cm(-2) at 80 degrees C. The prominent physicochemical properties are attributed to the well-developed microstructure of the Tb-PCEs, as revealed by TEM, AFM, and SAXS observations.","[Yang, Qian; Cai, Yuan Yuan; Zhu, Zhao Yu; Sun, Li Xuan; Zhang, Qiu Gen; Zhu, Ai Mei; Liu, Qing Lin] Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Fujian Prov Key Lab Theoret & Computat Chem, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Choo, Yvonne Shuen Lann] Xiamen Univ Malaysia, Sch Energy & Chem Engn, Sepang 43900, Selangor Darul, Malaysia","Liu, QL (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Fujian Prov Key Lab Theoret & Computat Chem, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",qlliu@xmu.edu.cn,"Choo, Yvonne S.

The LSCF was mixed with the SDC-carbonate (SDCC) composite electrolyte at different weight percentages (i.e., 30, 40, and 50 wt %) to prepare the LSCF-SDCC composite cathode. The effect of SDCC composite electrolyte content on the diffraction pattern, microstructure, specific surface area, and electrochemical performances of the LSCF-SDCC composite cathode were evaluated. The XRD pattern revealed that the SDCC phase diffraction peaks vary according to its increasing addition to the system. The introduction of SDCCs within the composite cathode did not change the LSCF phase structure and its specific surface area. However, the electrical performance of the realized cell drastically changed with the increase of the SDCC content in the LSCF microstructure. This drastic change can be ascribed to the poor in-plane electronic conduction at the surface of the LSCF cathode layer due to the presence of the insulating phase of SDC and molten carbonate. Among the cathodes investigated, LSCF-30SDCC showed the best cell performance, exhibiting a power density value of 60.3-75.4 mW/cm(2) at 600 degrees C to 650 degrees C.","[Ali, Muhammed S.

Herein, we report a novel fuel cell designed to mitigate coking, yielding superior performances but using conventional commercially-available materials. The new micro-monolithic design has an extraordinary geometrical asymmetry that separates the mechanical support and anode current collector from the electrochemically active region and results in significantly facilitated mass transport, yielding power densities of 1.77-2.22 W cm(-2)using LCVGs. In addition, the effluent containing only H-2, CO and CO(2)is of great industrial interest for methanol synthesis, if their ratios are adjusted appropriately. The new fuel cell developed was almost free from coke deactivation and was stable for over 500 h, indicating great promise for both efficient and environmentally benign use of LCVGs.","[Li, Tao; Rabuni, Mohamad F.; Wang, Bo; Li, Kang] Imperial Coll London, Dept Chem Engn, Barrer Ctr, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Lu, Xuekun; Brett, Dan J.

Incorporation of WO3 can extend the optical response range and boosted electrical conductivity of composite. Both the photoelectric and mineralization performance in degrading sunset yellow (SSY) and phenol as food wastewaters have been systematically tested under sunlight irradiation. The maximum power density (P-max) of the WO3/ZnO/Zn PFC was 0.1052 mu W cm(-2) and 0.0574 mu W cm(-2), which was 1.86 times and 1.85 times that of the pristine ZnO/Zn PFC in degrading SSY and phenol, respectively over 240 min period. The carbon oxygen demand (COD) removal of SSY and phenol using the WO3/ZnO/Zn PFC was 84.6% and 67.5%, respectively. The enhanced Z-scheme WO3/ZnO/Zn PFC could be ascribed to improved electron transfer via the hexagonal rod-like structure and efficient charge separation, and thereby maintained high redox ability for photoelectrochemical activity. Additionally, active species trapping and hydroxyl radical generation assays supported the Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism. Intermediates identification results showed an obvious decomposition effect towards both organic molecules. The WO3/ZnO/Zn PFC performance had also investigated in treating actual food wastewater, 63.6% COD was removed and generated 0.498 mu W cm(-2) P-max output.","[Lam, Sze-Mun; Sin, Jin-Chung; Lin, Hua; Li, Haixiang; Zeng, Honghu] Guilin Univ Technol, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Lam, Sze-Mun; Sin, Jin-Chung; Lin, Hua; Li, Haixiang; Zeng, Honghu] Guilin Univ Technol, Guangxi Key Lab Theory & Technol Environm Pollut, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Lam, Sze-Mun; Sin, Jin-Chung; Lin, Hua; Li, Haixiang; Zeng, Honghu] Guilin Univ Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Water Pollut Control & Wat, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Lam, Sze-Mun] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Engn & Green Technol, Dept Environm Engn, Kampar 31900, Perak, Malaysia; [Sin, Jin-Chung] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Engn & Green Technol, Dept Petrochem Engn, Kampar 31900, Perak, Malaysia; [Lim, Jun Wei] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, HICoE Ctr Biofuel & Biochem Res, Dept Fundamental & Appl Sci, Inst Selfsustainable Bldg, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak Darul Rid, Malaysia","Lam, SM; Zeng, HH (corresponding author), Guilin Univ Technol, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China.",lamsm@utar.edu.my; zenghonghu@glut.edu.cn,"CHUNG, SIN JIN/H-6001-2016; Lam, Sze Mun/H-6449-2016","CHUNG, SIN JIN/0000-0002-1177-5894; Lam, Sze Mun/0000-0001-5118-8144","Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman [UTARRF/2019-C1/L03]; Ministry of Higher Education of MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [FRGS/1/2016/TK02/UTAR/02/1, FRGS/1/2019/TK02/UTAR/02/4]; Guangxi Key Laboratory of Theory and Technology for Environmental Pollution Control, China [1801K012, 1801K013]; special funding for Guangxi Bagui Scholar construction project; L'Oreal-UNESCO Research Grant","The research was supported by Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTARRF/2019-C1/L03), Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia (FRGS/1/2016/TK02/UTAR/02/1 and FRGS/1/2019/TK02/UTAR/02/4), Research Funds of The Guangxi Key Laboratory of Theory and Technology for Environmental Pollution Control, China (1801K012 and 1801K013), special funding for Guangxi Bagui Scholar construction project, and L'Oreal-UNESCO Research Grant.",,47,6,6,18,40,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-4332,1873-5584,,APPL SURF SCI,Appl.

In this study, a three-dimensional (3-D) model with modified parallel flow field patterns is constructed, and simulation is performed to study the reactant distribution and cell performance. Two different modified parallel flow fields are applied to the cathode and anode. The flow characteristics and current density, temperature, and water distributions are analyzed with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The results indicate that the hydrogen and air reactants are uniformly distributed in a gas diffusion layer (GDL) and gradually decrease from the inlet to the outlet for all channels. The numerical results show that modified parallel flow fields provide evenly distributed current density generation, where the reactant is uniformly distributed in the flow field. This property reduced the likelihood of forming hot spots and consequently enhanced the PEMFC performance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Lim, B. H.; Majlan, E. H.; Daud, W. R.

A unique morphology has been obtained where microchannels were formed from multiple directions and the interchangeable thickness of sponge-like region between each channel and the exterior surface. Such micro-structured cells, which is made from commercially-available materials Ni-YSZ vertical bar YSZ vertical bar YSZ-LSM, exhibit superior performance for hydrogen (H-2) fuel cell achieving 1.62 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. Similarly, excellent performance for carbon dioxide (CO2) electrolysis has been demonstrated, achieving current densities up to 6.3 (3.1) A cm(-2) under 1.8 (1.5) V at 800 degrees C. To our knowledge, such high performances are one of the highest reported values for both H-2-fuel cell and CO2 electrolysis.

The established dual-cell hybrid system can reduce the recombination of electron and hole in photoanode and PFC acts as the power source for EF process. Hence, the optimal conditions for dye degradation synchronized with electricity generation in the dual-cell hybrid system should be determined. The in-situ generation of hydroxyl radicals was the key factor for dye degradation in the system. Hence, the operating parameters such as aeration and initial pH of dye were assessed. Higher decolourization efficiency was attained in aerated PFC (76.6%) and aerated EF process (84.5%). Enhanced power density (1.493 mu W cm(-2)) was achieved in aerated hybrid system through the elevated transfer of electrons from photoanode in PFC to the cathode of EF process. Acidic environment was favoured for the dye degradation in both PFC and EF process. At optimal pH 3, PFC and EF process attained highest colour removal efficiency which were 88.5% and 84.5%, respectively.

The cross-linking between SPPSU and SPOSS was accomplished through the interchain condensation of sulfonic acid functionalities initiated by thermal curing treatment. In this study, a covalently cross-linked membrane was obtained under stepwise thermal curing from 80 to 180 degrees C. Upon curing at 180 degrees C, the SPPSU-SPOSS showed considerable improvement on the membrane proton conductivity under low and high RH (%) conditions compared with the pristine SPPSU membrane. The membrane proton conductivity shows similar patterns with the membrane water uptake as the presence of water greatly influences the cross-linked membrane. The proton conductivity of the SPPSU cross-linked with 1 wt% SPOSS that was conducted under low RH (%) and at elevated temperature exhibited about six times higher proton conductivity as compared with pristine SPPSU membrane. However, increasing the loading of SPOSS beyond 1 wt% significantly dropped the membrane water uptake and proton conductivity due to SPOSS aggregation, blocking the hydrophilic domains in the polymer matrix. The results indicated that the incorporation of SPOSS in the SPPSU membrane by curing at 180 degrees C exhibit improvement on membrane water management and proton conductivity as compared with the pristine SPPSU membrane.","[Nor, Nor Azureen Mohamad; Kim, Je-Deok] NIMS, Hydrogen Prod Mat Grp, Ctr Green Res Energy & Environm Mat, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Nor, Nor Azureen Mohamad; Kim, Je-Deok] NIMS, Polymer Elect Fuel Cell Grp, Global Res Ctr Environm & Energy Based Nanomat Sc, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Nor, Nor Azureen Mohamad; Jaafar, Juhana] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Chem & Energy Engn, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia","Kim, JD (corresponding author), NIMS, Hydrogen Prod Mat Grp, Ctr Green Res Energy & Environm Mat, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan.; Kim, JD (corresponding author), NIMS, Polymer Elect Fuel Cell Grp, Global Res Ctr Environm & Energy Based Nanomat Sc, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan.; Jaafar, J (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Chem & Energy Engn, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",juhana@petroleum.utm.my; KIM.Jedeok@nims.go.jp,"Nor, Nor Azureen Mohamad/AAV-8366-2020",", Jedeok/0000-0003-4301-1044","Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) under project grant MRUN [R.J130000.7851.4L880]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia [UTMPR:Q.J130000.2851.00L22, UTM-TDR:Q.J130000.3551.06G88]; MEXT Program for the Development of Environmental Technology using Nanotechnology","This work was supported by Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) under project grant MRUN (R.J130000.7851.4L880) and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTMPR:Q.J130000.2851.00L22, UTM-TDR:Q.J130000.3551.06G88).

SOFCs offer several advantages over other types of fuel cells under relatively high temperatures (600 degrees C to 800 degrees C). However, the thermal behavior of SOFC stacks at high operating temperatures is a serious issue in SOFC development because it can be associated with detrimental thermal stresses on the life span of the stacks. The thermal behavior of SOFC stacks can be influenced by operating or material properties. Therefore, this work aims to investigate the effects of the thermal conductivity of each component (anode, cathode, and electrolyte) on the thermal behavior of samarium-doped ceria-based SOFCs at intermediate temperatures. Computational fluid dynamics is used to simulate SOFC operation at 600 degrees C. The temperature distributions and gradients of a single cell at 0.7 V under different thermal conductivity values are analyzed and discussed to determine their relationship. Simulations reveal that the influence of thermal conductivity is more remarkable for the anode and electrolyte than for the cathode. Increasing the thermal conductivity of the anode by 50% results in a 23% drop in the maximum thermal gradients. The results for the electrolyte are subtle, with a similar to 67% reduction in thermal conductivity that only results in an 8% reduction in the maximum temperature gradient. The effect of thermal conductivity on temperature gradient is important because it can be used to predict thermal stress generation.","[Aman, Nurul Ashikin Mohd Nazrul; Muchtar, Andanastuti; Baharuddin, Nurul Akidah; Somalu, Mahendra Rao; Kalib, Noor Shieela] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Muchtar, Andanastuti] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ctr Mat Engn & Smart Mfg MERCU, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Rosli, Masli Irwan] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ctr Sustainable Proc Technol CESPRO, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Kalib, Noor Shieela] Heriot Watt Univ Malaysia, Sch Engn & Phys Sci, Precinct 5, Putrajaya 62200, Malaysia","Muchtar, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.; Muchtar, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ctr Mat Engn & Smart Mfg MERCU, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",muchtar@ukm.edu.my,,,Ministry of Higher EducationScience and Technology Development Fund (STDF)Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR) [FRGS/1/2018/TK10/UKM/01/2],The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Higher Education for their support through the research grant FRGS/1/2018/TK10/UKM/01/2.,,28,0,0,0,0,KOREAN ELECTROCHEMISTRY SOC,SEOUL,"ROOM 1715, 122 WANGSAN-RO, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL, 130-070, SOUTH KOREA",2093-8551,,,J ELECTROCHEM SCI TE,J.

For power generation using advanced technologies, such as gas engines/turbines or solid oxide fuel cells, reducing the H2S content to acceptable levels is required. This work investigated the desulfurization performance of bimetallic particles by adding different metals (Fe, Cr, Co, Ni) into ZnO-based nanocomposites. At 400 degrees C, the Co-ZnO demonstrated 26.3, 5.0, 1.7 times higher sulfur uptake from a model syngas (composed of 100 ppmv H2S, 15 vol% CO, 5 vol% CO2, 15 vol% H-2, 15 vol% H2O and N-2 (balance)) than pure ZnO, Cr-ZnO and Fe-ZnO, respectively. This could be attributed to the formation of p-n heterojunction between the n-type ZnO and p-type Co3O4, accelerating surface reaction kinetics. Although the Ni-ZnO showed a better performance at 400 degrees C, at an elevated temperature of 600 degrees C, the Co-ZnO demonstrated 1.2 times higher sulfur capacity compared to Ni-ZnO. Furthermore, the Co-ZnO nanocomposite was subjected to 3 cycles of high-temperature desulfurization (600 degrees C) and regeneration. The results showed that its high desulfurization efficiency was retained after the tests. This could enable a high-temperature desulfurization of hot syngas and hence an increase in the electrical efficiency of waste-to-energy facilities.","[Pan, Zehua; Chan, Wei Ping; Da Oh, Wen; Veksha, Andrei; Tamilselvam, Kumaran S.

The primary characteristics of pristine Mindel and Mindel PEMs such as water uptake, methanol uptake, proton conductivity ion-exchange capacity (IEC), and chemical and mechanical stability were evaluated.

In this study, we report that the detrimental effect due to the CO2 interaction with perovskite oxide can be turned into a beneficial effect for facilitating ORR through tailoring the material composition of the perovskite. More specifically, for cobalt-free SrSc0.025Nb0.075Fe0.9O3-delta (SSNF), the exposure to the CO2 atmosphere results in the formation of a minor amount of surface strontium carbonate mainly in the form of a nanofilm over the perovskite surface, which protects the electrode from further corrosion by CO2, thus achieving a relatively stable performance even under a 10% CO2-containing air atmosphere. When CO2-free air is restored, the SrCO3 is successfully decomposed at intermediate temperatures. As a result, the surface reaction kinetics is recovered to the initial degree while the charge transfer process is obviously improved. An area-specific resistance of only 0.07 Omega cm(2) is achieved at 650 degrees C after the CO2-induced surface activation, much smaller than the original value of 0.13 Omega cm(2). In addition, the CO2-treated electrode shows a fairly stable performance for ORR under a subsequent CO2-free air atmosphere. To create such a beneficial effect, it is critical to tailor the degree of interaction of the perovskite surface with CO2, while the benchmark Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-d (BSCF) shows a too strong interaction with CO2 with the formation of bulk-phase-like carbonate, which failed to decomposed even when restored with a CO2-free atmosphere at intermediate temperatures, and as a result, worsened the ORR activity after the CO2 treatment.","[Gu, Hongxia; Yang, Guangming; Zhou, Chuan; Song, Yufei; Zhang, Yuan; Wang, Wei; Ran, Ran; Zhou, Wei; Shao, Zongping] Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem Engn, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Nanjing 211816, Peoples R China; [Shao, Zongping] Curtin Univ, WA Sch Mines Minerals Energy & Chem Engn, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Sunarso, Jaka] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Sarawak 93350, Malaysia","Yang, GM; Shao, ZP (corresponding author), Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem Engn, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Nanjing 211816, Peoples R China.; Shao, ZP (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, WA Sch Mines Minerals Energy & Chem Engn, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",ygm89525@njtech.edu.cn; shaozp@njtech.edu.cn,", 周嵬/B-1083-2012; , 王纬/F-9882-2015; Shao, Zongping/AAY-8177-2020",", 周嵬/0000-0003-0322-095X; , 王纬/0000-0001-7496-4548; Shao, Zongping/0000-0002-4538-4218","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21706129, 21878158, 21576135, 21828801]; Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars [BK20170043]","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 21706129, 21878158, 21576135, 21828801) and the Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (no.

Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) oxidize organics from sewage by exoelectrogens on anode to produce electricity while denitrifiers on cathode utilize the generated electricity to reduce nitrogen from contaminated groundwater. As the exoelectrogens are incapable of oxidizing insoluble, polymeric, and complex organics, a novel integration of an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) prior to the MFC simultaneously achieve hydrolytic-acidogenic conversion of complex organics, boost power recovery, and remove Carbon/Nitrogen (C/N) from the sewage and groundwater. The results obtained revealed increases in the fractions of soluble organics and volatile fatty acids in pretreated sewage by 52 +/- 19% and 120 +/- 40%, respectively. The optimum power and current generation with the pretreated sewage were 7.1 W m(-3) and 45.88 A m(-3), respectively, corresponding to 8% and 10% improvements compared to untreated sewage. Moreover, the integration of the ASBR with the biocathode MFC led to 217% higher carbon and 136% higher nitrogen removal efficiencies compared to the similar system without ASBR. The outcomes of the present study represent the promising prospects of using ASBR pretreatment and successive utilization of solubilized organics in denitrifying biocathode MFCs for simultaneous energy recovery and C/N removal from both sewage and nitrate nitrogen-contaminated groundwater.","[Al-Mamun, Abdullah; Jafary, Tahereh; Baawain, Mahad Said; Rahman, Sadik] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, POB 33, Muscat 123, Oman; [Jafary, Tahereh] Int Maritime Coll, Proc Engn Dept, Sohar, Oman; [Choudhury, Mahbuboor Rahman] Manhattan Coll, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 4513 Manhattan Coll Pkwy, Riverdale, NY 10471 USA; [Tabatabaei, Meisam] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Plantat & Agrotechnol, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia; [Tabatabaei, Meisam] Biofuel Res Team BRTeam, Karaj, Iran; [Tabatabaei, Meisam] AREEO, Microbial Biotechnol Dept, ABRII, Karaj, Iran; [Tabatabaei, Meisam] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Transport, Fac Mech Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Lam, Su Shiung] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Inst Trop Aquaculture & Fisheries Res Akuatrop, Pyrolysis Technol Res Grp, Terengganu 21030, Malaysia; [Lam, Su Shiung] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Inst Trop Biodivers & Sustainable Dev Bio D Trop, Terengganu 21030, Malaysia","Al-Mamun, A (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, POB 33, Muscat 123, Oman.",aalmamun@squ.edu.om,"Jafary, Tahereh/AAD-3280-2021; Al-Mamun, Abdullah/ABH-8121-2020; Lam, Su Shiung/K-7436-2012; Tabatabaei, Meisam/E-7235-2013","Al-Mamun, Abdullah/0000-0002-5642-2945; Lam, Su Shiung/0000-0002-5318-1760; Tabatabaei, Meisam/0000-0001-8067-1944","Sultan Qaboos University (SQU), Muscat, Oman through His Majesty's Trust Fund [SR/ENG/CAED/17/01]; Manhattan College, New York, USA","The authors wish to extend their appreciation to Sultan Qaboos University (SQU), Muscat, Oman, for financial support through His Majesty's Trust Fund (SR/ENG/CAED/17/01) collaborated with Manhattan College, New York, USA.",,57,3,3,6,26,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0013-9351,1096-0953,,ENVIRON RES,Environ.

A photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) employing an anodic TiO2/ZnO/Zn and a cathodic CuO/Cu has been applied to degrade the raw greywater, which realized advanced organics destruction, bacteria disinfection, and synchronously electricity production. The improved photocatalytic performance has been observed when the cell was incorporated with anodic TiO2/ZnO/Zn under UV and sunlight irradiation due to the enhanced electric field conductivity of the catalysts and heterojunction interface of TiO2. In the constructed UV-activated PFC system, the electricity production capability was observed with the measured voltage and power density of 868 mV and 0.0172 mW cm(-2), respectively. Advanced chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of greywater achieved a 100% completion within 60 min of light irradiation. The Eischerichia coli (E. coli) colonies decreased significantly and accounted similar to 99% disinfection efficiency. Moreover, the photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence (PL) experiments elucidated that the charge carrier separation efficiency were higher when TiO2 was coupled to ZnO. The organic matter elimination principle was assessed by radical trapping experiment, and the findings indicated that the hydroxyl (center dot OH) radical and hole (h(+)) appeared as major functions in the reaction. The stable cycle operation of the cell has been also obtained owing to the stable and film-type materials of anodic material. This performance was among the highest documented for PFC using real wastewater effluent as the fuel source. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Results revealed that the optimum of maximum power density was observed at iron plate size of 30 cm(2). UV light became a limiting factor in the PFC system as a power source in the PFC-PC system.

Hence, the effective PFC constructing from anodic TiO2/ZnO/Zn and cathodic TiO2/CuO/Cu was proposed for refractory palm oil mill effluent (POME) removal as well as energy recovery. Among the as-prepared photoanodes, anodic ZnO/Zn coated with 2 layers of TiO2 (TZ2) showed high crystallinity, low band gap, appropriate hydroxyl group and interfacial charge carrier separation that enable its superior photoactivity, which presented an enhancement of 3.67 times and 4.64 times in photocatalytic and energy performance over pristine ZnO/Zn. Among several examined influential parameters, the electrolyte concentration was the most influential factor due to its provision of OH- ions that can capture the photogenerated holes to enhance the electron-hole pair separation. The optimized system reached 90 % of COD removal efficiency of POME. Furthermore, an open circuit voltage (V-oc), short circuit current density (J(sc)) and power density (P-max) of 1173 mV, 0.2652 mA cm(-2) and 0.0734 mW cm(-2) was achieved, respectively. The photoanode maintained high recyclability performance after repeated experimental cycles. In-depth mechanism investigations confirmed that the marked cell performance was attributed to not only the accelerated charge carrier separation due to deposition of TiO2 onto ZnO/Zn as verified by the photoelectrochemical tests, but also the dominant active species, including hydroxyl ((OH)-O-center dot) radicals and hole (h(+)) found in the radical trapping study. The assessed electrical energy efficiency of PFC using anodic TZ2 manifested reduced energy consumption of 1.77 times as compared to PFC using pristine anodic ZnO. The toxicity experiments via wild algae indicated reduction in toxicity. This work advances the practical application of promising PFC for environmental protection and energy recovery.","[Kee, Ming-Wei; Lam, Sze-Mun] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Engn & Green Technol, Dept Environm Engn, Kampar 31900, Perak, Malaysia; [Sin, Jin-Chung] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Engn & Green Technol, Dept Petrochem Engn, Kampar 31900, Perak, Malaysia; [Lam, Sze-Mun; Sin, Jin-Chung; Zeng, Honghu] Guilin Univ Technol, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Mohamed, Abdul Rahman] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Chem Engn, Engn Campus, Nibong Tebal 14300, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia","Lam, SM (corresponding author), Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Engn & Green Technol, Dept Environm Engn, Kampar 31900, Perak, Malaysia.",lamsm@utar.edu.my,"CHUNG, SIN JIN/H-6001-2016; Mun, Lam Sze/H-6449-2016","CHUNG, SIN JIN/0000-0002-1177-5894; Mun, Lam Sze/0000-0001-5118-8144","Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman [UTARRF/2019-C1/L03]; Ministry of Higher Education of MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [FRGS/1/2016/TK02/UTAR/02/1, FRGS/1/2019/TK02/UTAR/02/4]; Research funds of The Guangxi Key Laboratory of Theory and Technology for Environmental Pollution Control, China [1801K012, 1801K013]; L'Oreal-UNESCO Research Grant","The research was supported by Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTARRF/2019-C1/L03), Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia (FRGS/1/2016/TK02/UTAR/02/1 and FRGS/1/2019/TK02/UTAR/02/4), Research funds of The Guangxi Key Laboratory of Theory and Technology for Environmental Pollution Control, China (1801K012 and 1801K013), and L'Oreal-UNESCO Research Grant.",,60,3,3,8,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",1010-6030,,,J PHOTOCH PHOTOBIO A,J.

This study investigates the fabrication of TLHF in solid oxide fuel cell consisting anode/anode functional layer (AFL)/electrolyte (NiO-YSZ/NiO-YSZ/YSZ) via single-step phase inversion-based co-extrusion combined with co-sintering technique using methane as fuel. TLHF formed sandwich-like structure that corresponds to the anode and AFL with dense electrolyte. Initially, the open circuit voltage (OCV) was 1.1 V, after 90 min, the OCV dropped to 0.2 V due to the carbon deposits that caused poisoning. Meanwhile, the power density also reduces from 0.8 to 0.33 Wcm(-2). SEM image carbon shows the carbon deposited causing crack and reached electrolyte layer. TEM of the Ni catalyst indicates there are multilayer of graphite exhibit at the Ni particle courtesy of the carbon deposits. The results showed the graphite causing the performance to decrease which is corresponding to the usage of methane as fuel.","[Mohamed, Mohd Hilmi; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan; Hubadillah, Siti Khadijah] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Chem & Energy Engn, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, N29a, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Mohamed, Mohd Hilmi; Yusop, Mohd Zamri] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Mat, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Iwamoto, Yuji] Nagoya Inst Technol, Dept Life Sci & Appl Chem, Showa Ku, Gokiso Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, Japan; [Bakar, Suriani Abu] Univ Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Fac Sci & Math, Dept Phys, Nanotechnol Res Ctr, Tanjung Malim 35900, Perak, Malaysia; [Fansuri, Hamzah] Inst Teknol Sepuluh Nopember, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Kampus ITS Sukolilo, Surabaya 60111, Indonesia","Othman, MHD (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Chem & Energy Engn, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, N29a, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",dzarfan@utm.my,"Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan/J-8230-2015","Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan/0000-0002-5842-2447","Universiti Teknologi Malaysia [Q.J130000.7746.4J309, Q.J130000.2546.16H40]","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under Research University Grant R&D Fund (Project number: Q.J130000.7746.4J309) and Tier 1 (Project number: Q.J130000.2546.16H40)).

The as-synthesized rGO/PtNPs catalyst was extensively characterized in which demonstrated that the PtNPs have successfully anchored on the surface of rGO with the small average particle size of 4 nm. The evaluation of electrocatalytic activity and durability performance of the as-synthesized rGO/PtNPs nanocomposite catalyst towards methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) as well as the determination of electrochemical surface area (ECSA) were carried out by cyclic voltammogram and chronoamperometry. Besides, the as-prepared rGO/PtNPs nanocomposite catalyst has further proved the remarkably higher electrocatalytic property which exhibited superior maximum forward peak current density (64.04 mA/cm(2)) toward MOR in acidic media compared with Vulcan XC72/PtNPs (47.54 mA/cm(2)) and rGO/PdNPs (6.21 mA/cm(2)) catalysts owing to homogenous distribution and synergic effects of PtNPs with rGO as well as improved electron transfer by rGO. Moreover, the rGO/PtNPs nanocomposite catalyst still achieve the high current density even after 2900 s of continuous catalyst at 0.6 V. This study provides new insights into the production of superior electrocatalytic activity and durability of anode catalyst through a facile, low cost and clean synthesis approach for the enhancement of direct methanol fuel cell performance.","[Hanifah, Mohamad Fahrul Radzi; Jaafar, Juhana; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi; Rahman, Mukhlis A.; Yusof, Norhaniza; Aziz, Farhana] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Chem & Energy Engn, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia","Hanifah, MFR; Jaafar, J (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Chem & Energy Engn, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",mfahrulradzi@gmail.com; juhana@petroleum.utm.my,"Hanifah, Mohamad Fahrul Radzi/AAO-9346-2020","Hanifah, Mohamad Fahrul Radzi/0000-0002-5213-0865",Ministry of Education Malaysia under UTM Transdisciplinary Research Grant [Q.

There are various measurement technologies, including contact and non-contact measurement. Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) technology is a proven non-contact method for detection of the temperature and species concentration by absorption measurement. To enable two-dimensional (2D) representation of temperature and species concentration in combustion fields, the TDLAS technology is usually combined with computed tomography (CT). The latter is, however, considerably new in combustion research, especially in the solid fuel reaction environment. In this paper, a 32-path 2D CT-TDLAS system for temperature measurement in a pilot-scale coal-fired furnace was developed. The accuracy of the CT algorithm in the reconstruction of 2D temperature distributions in different laser-path arrangements was first analyzed using the sum of squared difference (SSD) and zero-mean normalized cross-correlation (ZNCC) by comparing it to the 2D temperature distribution of a full-scale coal-fired furnace simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The accuracy was improved by 32-path reconstruction. The study was then progressed to investigate its measurement accuracy in a simple CH4-air burner configuration with rounded and rectangular cells as well as sensitivity for flame shift detection, whereby the reconstructed temperature distribution was compared to the temperature measured using a thermocouple. It is verified that this CT reconstruction was feasible for various measurement areas, even if the center of the flame was shifted. Finally, a 32-path 2D CT-TDLAS system with a rectangular-structured cell was developed and applied for temperature measurement in a Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) Research's pilot-scale coal-fired furnace. The 2D temperature distribution in the coal-fired furnace was reconstructed according to the experimental results. The potential of the CT-TDLAS for online 2D temperature measurement for actual applications is demonstrated.","[Wang, Zhenzhen; Zhou, Wangzheng; Yan, Junjie; Deguchi, Yoshihiro] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Multiphase Flow Power Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhenzhen; Yan, Junjie; Kamimoto, Takahiro; Tsujimoto, Kazuma; Li, Yi; Deguchi, Yoshihiro] Tokushima Univ, Grad Sch Adv Technol & Sci, Tokushima 7708501, Japan; [Sani, Nursalwa Ahmad; Samsuri, Shazarizul Haziq; Zulkifli, Meor Faisal] TNB Res Sdn Bhd, Kajang Selangor 43000, Malaysia","Deguchi, Y (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Multiphase Flow Power Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.; Deguchi, Y (corresponding author), Tokushima Univ, Grad Sch Adv Technol & Sci, Tokushima 7708501, Japan.",ydeguchi@tokushima-u.ac.jp,,,"Tenaga Nasional Berhad Research (TNB Research); Laboratory on Advanced Laser Measurement Technology for Industrial Applications; Xi'an Jiaotong University, ChinaXi'an Jiaotong University; Tokushima University, Japan","The financial support from Tenaga Nasional Berhad Research (TNB Research) through a research collaboration with the Laboratory on Advanced Laser Measurement Technology for Industrial Applications (a joint research laboratory of Xi'an Jiaotong University, China and Tokushima University, Japan) is gratefully acknowledged.",,37,1,1,11,23,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0957-0233,1361-6501,,MEAS SCI TECHNOL,Meas.

The self-fabricated composite membranes are Graphene Oxide/Sulfonated Polyether Ether Ketone (GO-SPEEK) and Silver Graphene Oxide/Graphene Oxide/Sulfonated Polyether Ether Ketone (AgGO-GO-SPEEK). The proton conductivity of AgGO-GO-SPEEK membrane is 54.2% higher and the oxygen diffusion coefficient is 76.7% lower than Nafion (R) 117 membrane, yielding higher selectivity as separator in MFC applications. At the earlier optimum stage, MFC with GO-SPEEK generates the highest maximum power density (1134 mW m(-2)). Voltage achieved for first three feed cycles after enrichment are 620 mV-650 my for all MFC system. However, the highest maximum power density (896 mW m(-3)) is attained by MFC with AgGO-GO-SPEEK membrane after 100 days of operation. The Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) results show that AgGO-GO-SPEEK membrane has the lowest increment in terms of the membrane's resistance. AgGO-GO-SPEEK,a better anti-biofouling property membrane, leads to a longer and stable power production, caused by the better ion transport through membrane. The results indicated that AgGO-GO-SPEEK membrane is a promising alternative membrane to replace Nafion (R) 117 as a separator in the MFC.","[Liew, Kien Ben; Hwang, Jenn Jiang] Natl Univ Tainan, Dept Greenergy Technol, Tainan 70005, Taiwan; [Leong, Jun Xing; Daud, Wan Ramli Wan] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Daud, Wan Ramli Wan] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Chem & Proc Engn, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Alunad, Azizan] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol, Sch Chem Sci & Food Technol, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Liew, Kien Ben; Wu, Wei] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan","Wu, W (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",weiwu@mail.ncku.edu.tw,"Daud, Wan Ramli Wan/B-3635-2013","Daud, Wan Ramli Wan/0000-0002-1023-456X","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Malaysia [DIP-2012-27];  [107RSG0011]","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the research grant of DIP-2012-27 by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Malaysia, and the Ministry of Education, Taiwan for its partial financial support of this research under grant 107RSG0011.",,73,6,6,10,33,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-7753,1873-2755,,J POWER SOURCES,J.

The anode powder is prepared through a microwave-assisted glycine nitrate combustion process, and its properties, including phase and chemical composition as well as morphology, are characterized by XRD, TEM, and EDS techniques. The electrical conductivity and electrochemical behavior under low concentration of dry hydrogen (H-2:N-2 volume ratio = 10:90) and dry methane (CH4:N-2 volume ratio = 50:50) fuels are determined. XRD results show two phases, namely, cubic NiO phase and cubic 10Sc1CeSZ phase, with the crystallite sizes of 67 and 40 nm, respectively. The area specific resistances (ASRs) of the prepared anode measured using a symmetrical cell of Ni/10Sc1CeSZ|10Sc1CeSZ|Ni/10Sc1CeSZ are 0.96 and 24.3 omega cm(2) observed at 800 degrees C in dry low hydrogen concentration (10 vol% hydrogen-90 vol% nitrogen) and dry methane (50 vol% methane-50 vol% nitrogen) fuels, respectively. The ASR in methane fuel is higher than that in hydrogen fuel at all operating temperatures (600-800 degrees C) because of carbon deposition. The amount of deposited carbon and degree of graphitization (I-G/I-D) of this anode after exposure in methane at 800 degrees C for 3 h are 4.34% and 2.1, respectively. Overall, Ni/10Sc1CeSZ cermet synthesized by glycine nitrate process assisted with microwave-heating technique exhibits acceptable electrochemical behavior even at low hydrogen concentration and also in dry methane. This can be related to the improved powder morphology as a result of uniform heating assisted by microwave energy.","[Jais, Abdul Azim; Ali, S. A.

Numerical simulation was used to create cell models with modified convergent serpentine flow slabs of four different channel widths such as TS28, TS36, TS44 and TS52 and performance comparison was done with a common serpentine flow slab (OS) PEM fuel cell. All the cells had the same reaction area of 25.7X24 mm and rib ratio of 51%. The TS fuel cells produced similar voltage ranging from 1-1.1 V, power density of 650 to 675 mW/cm(2) and current density of 2550 to 2700 mA/cm(2). The OS PEM fuel cell produced similar voltage (1.1 V) and power density (660 mW/cm2) compared to TS fuel cells but very less current density (1861 mA/cm(2)) output was observed. The experimental results evidenced that the modified flow slabs were superior in controlling the cell performance compared to traditional flow slab irrespective of their channel width. This was due to the fact that improper fuel mixing was eradicated and the flow slab effectively postponed concentration polarization. Therefore, these findings would provide progressive insights for future applications of PEM fuel cells.","[Wang, Chin-Tsan] Natl Ilan Univ, Dept Mech & Electromech Engn, Ilan, Taiwan; [Wu, Jung-Chen] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Garg, Akhil] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Digital Mfg Equipment & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Chong, Wen-Tong; Ong, Hwai-Chyuan] Univ Malaya, Dept Mech Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Wu, Bing-Xue; Jang, Jer-Huan] Ming Chi Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, New Taipei, Taiwan","Wang, CT (corresponding author), Natl Ilan Univ, Dept Mech & Electromech Engn, Ilan, Taiwan.",,"Ong, Hwai Chyuan/A-9492-2013; Chong, Wen Tong/B-8396-2010","Ong, Hwai Chyuan/0000-0002-6731-4800; Chong, Wen Tong/0000-0002-9208-9908","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 107-2622-E-197-006-CC3, 107-2221-E-197-022-MY3, 106-2923-E-197-001MY3]","The authors whole-heartedly acknowledge the substantial financial support from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under the contract number #MOST 107-2622-E-197-006-CC3, 107-2221-E-197-022-MY3 and 106-2923-E-197-001MY3.

However, the performance and lifetime of sPEEK membrane depend on the degree of sulfonation (DS). High DS of sPEEK increases the performance, but the mechanical properties could deteriorate progressively which affect its lifetime. Thus, this study investigated the effect of adding polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) into high DS (80%) of sPEEK through solution blending method toward its physicochemical properties and morphology structures. The PVDF concentration was varied to 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt% relative to the sPEEK content. The existence of hydrophobic PVDF in 80% sPEEK improved the mechanical properties where the water uptake and swelling degree of membrane decreased, whereas the tensile strength increased. The sPEEK/PVDF 15 exhibited the highest proton conductivity (46.23 mS cm(-1)) at 80 degrees C. Incorporating PVDF into high DS of sPEEK enhanced the mechanical properties which can be used as a proton-conducting membrane for fuel cell that may improve the performance and prolong the lifetime of the cell.","[Daud, Syarifah Noor Syakiylla Sayed; Norddin, Muhammad Noorul Anam Mohd; Jaafar, Juhana] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Chem & Energy Engn, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Johor Baharu, Johor, Malaysia; [Sudirman, Rubita] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Elect Engn, Johor Baharu, Johor, Malaysia","Jaafar, J (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Chem & Energy Engn, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Utm Johor Bahru 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",juhana@petroleum.utm.my,,,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under TIER 1 grant [Q.J130000.2546.17H77]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under HICOE grant [R.J090301.7846. 4J207]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under TDR grant [Q.J130000.3551.06G88]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under MRUN Translational Research Grant [R.J130000.7851.4L880]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under GENSET grant [R.J130000.7751.4J352]; Ministry of Education,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was financially supported by the Ministry of Education and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under TIER 1 grant (Q.J130000.2546.17H77) HICOE grant (R.J090301.7846. 4J207), TDR grant (Q.J130000.3551.06G88), MRUN Translational Research Grant (R.J130000.7851.4L880), and GENSET grant (R.J130000.7751.4J352).",,46,1,1,7,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0954-0083,1361-6412,,HIGH PERFORM POLYM,High Perform.

The cathode nanopowder was synthesized by employing a dispersing agent-assisted sol-gel method. Two types of dispersing agents were applied as the synthesizing aids in this study which are the activated carbon (AC) and ethylene glycol (EG). The synthesized cathode powder was systematically characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and BET surface area analyzer. The electrochemical properties of the fabricated cell were evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). TGA analysis shows that both dispersing agents decomposed below 600 degrees C. The XRD analysis demonstrates that the single-phase LSCF perovskite is attainable at the calcination temperature of 700 degrees C for 5 h. FESEM results are in accordance with the BET analysis in which application of the dispersing agents produced more dispersed cathode powders and larger surface area. The electrochemical performances of the LSCF cathode modified with the AC and EG are respectively in the average of six- and eightfolds higher as compared with the pristine LSCF. The dispersing reaction of AC and EG and their influences on the cathode microstructure and performance are also thoroughly discussed.

Chronoamperometry tests ranged between 0.3 and 2.0 V were carried out after both bioelectrodes were developed. A maximum current density up to 1.6 A m(-2) was recorded at 1.0 V with hydrogen production rate of nearly 6.0 +/- 1.5 L m(-2) cathode day(-1). Trace amounts of methane, acetone and formate were detected in cathode's headspace and catholyte which followed the same trend as hydrogen production rate. Meanwhile substrate consumption in anolyte also followed the trend of hydrogen production and current density changes. The bioanode could utilise up to 95% of acetate in the tested voltage ranges, however, at a cell voltage of 2.0 V the bioanode's activity stopped due to oxygen evolution from water hydrolysis. Cyclic voltammograms revealed that the bioanode activity was vital to maintain the functionality of the whole system. The biocathode relied on the bioanode to maintain its potential during the hydrogen evolution. The overall energy efficiency recovered from both bioanode and external power in terms of hydrogen production at the cathode was determined as 29.4 +/- 9.0%, within which substrate oxidation contributed up to nearly 1/3 of the total energy marking the importance of bioanode recovering energy from wastewater to reduce the external power supply.

However, removal of the unwanted CO2 through adsorption is required before any system is supplied with high-purity H-2 gas. Herein, we prepared a novel carbon nanoflake hybrid for efficient biohydrogen CO2 capture by combining the advantages of carbon, metal oxide, and amine. Among the samples, SH800 showed a remarkable high CO2 adsorption capacity of 29.8 wt.% (6.77 mmol/g) at 25 degrees C and 1 atm, the highest ever reported at low pressure and temperature. The regeneration experiment also demonstrated robust reversibility over five cycles in the absence of heat treatment. Moreover, it displayed a highly accessible adsorption site with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 600 m(2)/g and an optimal 6.6-nm average mesopore structure. Another hybrid named SH500 was also developed. This hybrid showed a comparable CO2 uptake of 27.8 wt.%, being competitive to SH800 but with entirely different chemical properties. Both samples were analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), BET, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, (XPS) and were tested for CO2 capture through a breakthrough experiment. A highly porous solid adsorbent was also produced via soft-template synthesis.

The X-ray diffraction patterns were employed to confirm the nanocomposite crystal system of Co3O4/rGO by demonstrating the existence of normal cubic spinet structure of Co3O4 in the matrix of Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite. FTIR and FT-Raman studies manifested the structural behaviour and quality of prepared Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite. The optical properties of the nanocomposite Co3O4/rGO have been investigated by UV absorption spectra. The SEM/TEM images showed that the Co3O4 nanoparticles in the Co3O4/rGO nanocomposites were covered over the surface of the rGO sheets. The electrical properties were analyzed in terms of real and imaginary permittivity, dielectric loss and AC conductivity. The electrocatalytic activities of synthesized Co3O4/rGO nanocomposites were determined by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge cycle to evaluate the supercapacitive performance. The specific capacitance of 754 Fg(-1) was recorded for Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite based electrode in three electrode cell system. The electrode material exhibited an acceptable capability and excellent long-term cyclic stability by maintaining 96% after 1000 continuous cycles. These results showed that the prepared sample could be an ideal candidate for high-energy application as electrode materials. The synthesized Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite is a versatile material and can be used in various application such as fuel cells, electrochemical sensors, gas sensors, solar cells, and photocatalysis.

This occurs when the load frequency control of interconnected system is unable to compensate the power balance between generation and load demand. Also owing to the enhancement of future transport, the Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) plays a significant role to customer at demand side. Thus, the PEV can act as a power control to compensate the power balance in Renewable Energy integrated power system. This paper presents a physics inspired Atom Search Optimization (ASO) algorithm for tuning the parameters of Fractional Order Proportional-Integral-Derivative (FOPID) controller for Automatic Load Frequency control of HPS. In this proposed work, an attempt has been made to analyze the frequency stability of HPS using Matignon's theorem. The interconnected HPS consists of reheat thermal power system, RE sources such as wind and solar thermal power generation associated with energy storage devices namely aqua electrolyzer, fuel cell and electric vehicle. The gain and fractional terms of the controller were obtained by minimizing the Integral Time Absolute Error of interconnected system. The robustness of ASO-tuned FOPID controller is tested on two-area HPS that was modelled using MATLAB/Simulink. The results obtained were then compared with other fractional order and classical integer order controllers. From the simulation results, it is inferred that the proposed ASO-tuned FOPID controller gives superior transient and steady-state response compared with other controllers. Moreover, the self-adaptiveness and robustness of the controller was validated to account for the change in RE power generations and system parameters. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the method is proved by comparing its performance with the recent literature works. The real-time applicability of proffered controller is validated in hardware-in-the-loop simulation using Real Time Digital Simulator.","[Irudayaraj, Andrew Xavier Raj; Wahab, Noor Izzri Abdul; Mohd Radzi, Mohd Amran; Sulaiman, Nasri Bin; Veerasamy, Veerapandiyan] Univ Putra Malaysia UPM, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Adv Lightning Power & Energy Res ALPER, Seri Kembangan 43400, Malaysia; [Umamaheswari, Mallapu Gopinath] Rajalakshmi Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Chennai 602105, Tamil Nadu, India; [Prasanna, S.

Yet, the energy conversion of conventional fossil fuel power generation plants remains relatively low (less than 40%) and a huge amount of energy is wasted in the form of heat, leading to global warming issues. Recycling and recuperating even a small portion of energy losses could provide a huge impact on energy saving and minimize the reliance on fossil fuels. Thermophotovoltaic system appears to be a potential candidate to capture, recover, and convert waste heat energy into useful electricity. This paper presents an overview of the recent development of thermophotovoltaic technology for waste heat recovery applications. Each component in the thermophotovoltaic system including thermophotovoltaic generator/heat source, thermal emitter, spectral filter and thermophotovoltaic cells is vital and can be engineered to achieve a better heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency. Recently, researchers have shown great interest in near-field thermophotovoltaic systems where higher power intensity can be captured by the thermophotovoltaic cell, thus improving the overall system performance. Furthermore, the potential locations for energy scavenging in thermal power plants is investigated based on the on-site temperature measurement. In Malaysia, it is estimated that around 3,831 GWh of waste heat energy could be saved in operational thermal power plants. This review will contribute to the knowledge for future development thermophotovoltaic systems in waste heat recovery applications while summarizing the potential locations for energy scavenging in thermal power plants.","[Rashid, Wan Emilin Suliza Wan Abdul; Bin Jamaludin, Md Zaini] Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Power Engn, Kajang 43000, Malaysia; [Ker, Pin Jern; Gamel, Mansur Mohammed Ali] Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Sustainable Energy, Kajang 43000, Malaysia; [Lee, Hui Jing; Bin Abd Rahman, Nazaruddin] Univ Tenaga Nas, Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Kajang 43000, Malaysia","Bin Jamaludin, MZ (corresponding author), Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Power Engn, Kajang 43000, Malaysia.",mdzaini@uniten.edu.my,"Rahman, Nazaruddin Abd/AAS-9108-2020; balachandran, kiran/AAX-4637-2020","Rahman, Nazaruddin Abd/0000-0002-0209-1538; Wan Abdul Rashid, Wan Emilin Suliza/0000-0003-4244-6732; Ker, Pin Jern/0000-0002-5703-1735",Tenaga Nasional Berhad Seeding fund through the UNITEN RD Sdn.

We show that the solar-powered HAPs are energy and weight limited, and this depends largely on the platform's wingspan available for the deployment of solar collectors. Our analysis show that services can be provided for a duration of 15-24 h/day using current platforms, with wingspans ranging between 25-35 m, depending on the configuration and coverage radius. Furthermore, we show that doubling an aircraft's wingspan can increase its payload capacity by a factor of 6, which in turn enhances its feasibility for wireless communications.","[Arum, Steve Chukwuebuka; Grace, David; Mitchell, Paul Daniel; Morozs, Nils] Univ York, Dept Elect Engn, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Zakaria, Muhammad Danial] Univ Sultan Zainal Abidin, Fac Informat & Comp, Tembila Campus Terengganu, Terengganu 21300, Malaysia","Arum, SC (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Elect Engn, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",steve.arum@york.ac.uk; david.grace@york.ac.uk; paul.mitchell@york.ac.uk; mdanialzakaria@unisza.edu.my; nils.morozs@york.ac.uk,,"Arum, Steve/0000-0001-6199-3024; Morozs, Nils/0000-0001-9862-7378",Orange [H09121],This research was carried out by University of York and has been funded by Orange under research agreement No: H09121.

The obtained Ir-Zn/GNP catalyst with ratio of Ir:Zn = 50:50 (Ir50Zn50/GNP) exhibited better electrocatalytic activity than GNP-supported iridium catalyst (Ir/GNP) for formic acid oxidation. Although the oxidation peak current density of Ir50Zn50/GNP was slightly lower than that of Ir/GNP, the oxidation peak potential shifted more negatively (193 mV) than Ir/GNP with higher value of the ratio of forward scan to reverse the scan peak current (If/Ib). The presence of Zn also enhanced the power density and current generation with increased performance stability in a passive DFAFC cell tests. The improvement of the electrochemical performance was ascribed to the ensemble effect where the addition of Zn could modify the Ir atom arrangement, thereby promoting the oxidation through dehydrogenation pathway. However, extremely high Zn content would inhibit oxidation capability because Zn atoms might reduce the Ir catalytic sites. A new alternative for non-Pt and non-Pd anode catalysts for DFAFC applications was successfully achieved.","[Ahmad, Khairul Naim; Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan; Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Chem & Proc Engn, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ahmad, Khairul Naim; Azam, Adam Mohd Izhan; Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan; Zainoodin, Azran Mohd; Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan; Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Res Ctr Sustainable Proc Technol CESPRO, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia","Isahak, WNRW (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Chem & Proc Engn, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.; Isahak, WNRW (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.; Isahak, WNRW (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Res Ctr Sustainable Proc Technol CESPRO, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",wannorroslam@ukm.edu.my,"Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin/M-2008-2016; Ahmad, Khairul Naim/AAC-4210-2021; Wan Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam/C-6454-2015","Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin/0000-0001-5714-7415; Ahmad, Khairul Naim/0000-0002-2257-6962; Wan Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam/0000-0002-1051-3120",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) [DIP-2018-021],"The authors wish to thank Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) for funding this project under research grant, DIP-2018-021 and the Centre of Research and Innovation Management (CRIM) UKMfor the use of the instruments.",,39,0,0,4,9,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",,2053-1591,,MATER RES EXPRESS,Mater.

Recent studies revealed that the fullerenes can be used as drug carriers and transport drugs in a target cell. The aim of the present work is to study the interaction of C60 fullerene containing porphyrin-like transitionmetal-N4 clusters (TMN4C55, TM = Fe, Co, and Ni) with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ibuprofen (Ibp)) by employing the method of the density functional theory. Results showed that the C60 fullerene with TMN4 clusters could significantly enhance the tendency of C60 for adsorption of ibuprofen drug. Also, our ultraviolet-visible results show that the electronic spectra of Ibp/TMN4C55 complexes exhibit a blue shift toward lower wavelengths (higher energies). It was found that the NiN4C55 fullerene had high chemical reactivity, which was important for binding of the drug onto the carrier surface. In order to gain insight into the binding features of Ibp/TMN4C55 complexes, the atoms in molecules analysis was also performed. Our results exhibit the electrostatic features of the Ibp/TMN4C55 bonding. Consequently, this study demonstrated that the TMN4C55 fullerenes could be used as potential carriers for delivery of Ibp drug in the nanomedicine domain.","[Alipour, Elham] Bu Ali Sina Univ, Fac Chem, Dept Organ Chem, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran; [Alimohammady, Farzaneh] PNU, Dept Chem, POB 19395-3697, Tehran, Iran; [Yumashev, Alexei] IM Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Dept Prosthet Dent, Moscow, Russia; [Maseleno, Andino] Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Informat & Comp Energy, Kajang, Malaysia","Alipour, E (corresponding author), Bu Ali Sina Univ, Fac Chem, Dept Organ Chem, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran.",elhamalipour2018@gmail.com,"Yumashev, Alexey V/H-2630-2018","Yumashev, Alexey V/0000-0002-5184-0195",Bu-Ali Sina University Iran,The authors are grateful to Bu-Ali Sina University Iran for the computational resources and financial support.,,59,3,3,7,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2940,0948-5023,,J MOL MODEL,J.

In this regard, exploiting the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) for producing high value bioproducts and bioenergy under a biorefinery approach has attracted great interest. This paper presents the state of the art of urban biowaste biorefinery concepts. Accordingly, different novel valorization pathways, namely single cell protein, biosuccinic acid, and lactic acid, as well as bioenergy production were consolidated into some scenarios. Moreover, successfully tested hydrogen-assisted biological biogas upgrading was also incorporated into some scenarios as energy source for methanotrophs to upcycle nitrogen rich digestate into single cell protein. Upon the successful lab-scale experiments, different biorefinery platforms were developed and their sustainability was environmentally scrutinized using consequential life cycle assessment. The results obtained herein demonstrated that despite having different net environmental benefits, all the developed scenarios were eco-friendly solutions for valorizing biowaste into bioproducts and bioenergy. Scenarios including microbial protein production led to a saving of -58 to -147 kg CO2,eq/t biopulp in Climate change category, depending on the biorefining pathway. The net saving in Climate change category achieved for Succinic acid- and Lactic acid-based biorefinery was estimated at -73 and -173 kg CO2,eq/t biopulp, respectively. Biological biogas upgrading, if implemented, could increase energy payback by 9724 MJ/t biopulp and contribute more to the sustainability of other developed scenarios. Although scenarios with the main focus on bioenergy production outperformed others in terms of environmental sustainability, some complementary factors such as policy decisions, energy directives, economic issues, and carbon trade schemes must be taken into account in order to introduce the best valorization pathway.","[Khoshnevisan, Benyamin] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Key Lab Nonpoint Source Pollut Control, Minist Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Tabatabaei, Meisam] Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Fac Plantat & Agrotechnol, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia; [Tabatabaei, Meisam] Biofuel Res Team BRTeam, Karaj, Iran; [Tsapekos, Panagiotis] AREEO, ABRII, Microbial Biotechnol Dept, Karaj, Iran; [Tsapekos, Panagiotis; Angelidaki, Irini] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Rafiee, Shahin; Aghbashlo, Mortaza] Univ Tehran, Fac Agr Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Engn Agr Machinery, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Tehran, Iran; [Lindeneg, Susanne] Tech & Environm Adm, Unit Resources & Waste Planning, City Dev, DK-2300 Copenhagen, Denmark","Khoshnevisan, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Key Lab Nonpoint Source Pollut Control, Minist Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.; Tabatabaei, M (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Fac Plantat & Agrotechnol, Biofuel Res Team BRTeam, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia.",benkho@caas.cn; meisam_tab@yahoo.com,"Tabatabaei, Meisam/E-7235-2013; Angelidaki, Irini/AAX-2562-2020","Tabatabaei, Meisam/0000-0001-8067-1944; Angelidaki, Irini/0000-0002-6357-578X; Tsapekos, Panagiotis/0000-0002-5309-4624",Copenhagen municipality,The authors would like to thank the Copenhagen municipality for its financial support.

The current study assessed the ability of the psychrotolerant phenol-degrader, Rhodococcus sp. strain AQ5-07, to assimilate diesel fuel as the sole carbon source. Factors expected to influence the efficiency of diesel degradation, including the initial hydrocarbon concentration, nitrogen source concentration and type, temperature, pH and salinity were studied. Strain AQ5-07 displayed optimal cell growth and biodegradation activity at 1% v/v initial diesel concentration, 1 g/L NH4Cl concentration, pH 7 and 1% NaCl during one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) analyses. Strain AQ5-07 was psychrotolerant based on its optimum growth temperature being near 20 degrees C. In conventionally optimised media, strain AQ5-07 showed total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) mineralisation of 75.83%. However, the optimised condition for TPH mineralisation predicted through statistical response surface methodology (RSM) enhanced the reduction to 90.39% within a 2 days incubation. Our preliminary data support strain AQ5-07 being a potential candidate for real-field soil bioremediation by specifically adopting sludge-phase bioreactor system in chronically cold environments such as Antarctica. The study also confirmed the utility of RSM in medium optimisation.","[Roslee, Ahmad Fareez Ahmad; Zakaria, Nur Nadhirah; Lee, Gillian Li Yin; Ahmad, Siti Aqlima] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Dept Biochem, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Convey, Peter] British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Zulkharnain, Azham] Shibaura Inst Technol, Coll Syst Engn & Sci, Dept Biosci & Engn, Minuma Ku, 307 Fukasaku, Saitama 3378570, Japan; [Gomez-Fuentes, Claudio] Univ Magallanes, Dept Chem Engn, Avda Bulnes, Punta Arenas 01855, Chile","Ahmad, SA (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Dept Biochem, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",aqlima@upm.edu.my,"Convey, Peter/AAV-5728-2020; Zakaria, Nur Nadhirah/ABE-2291-2020; Zulkharnain, Azham/AAV-1241-2020","Convey, Peter/0000-0001-8497-9903; Zulkharnain, Azham/0000-0001-9173-8171","Putra-IPM fund [2016/9300430, GPM-2018/9660000, GPM-2019/9678900, 2017/9300436]; YPASM Smart Partnership Initiative by Sultan Mizan Antarctic Research Foundation (YPASM); NERCNERC Natural Environment Research Council; Centro de Investigacion y Monitoreo Ambiental Antarctico (CIMAA) Project; Public Service Department of Malaysia (JPA)","This project was financially supported by Putra-IPM fund under the research grant attached to S.A.

The treatment of PCW by conventional aerobic and anaerobic methods is energy intensive. Therefore, the treatment of PCW with concurrent power generation by employing microbial fuel cell (MFC) could be a potential alternative to solve the energy and environmental issues. This study demonstrates the potentiality of PCW from acrylic acid plant with an initial COD of 45,000 mg L-1 generating maximum power density of 850 mW m(-2) at a current density of 1500 mA m(-2) using acclimatized anaerobic sludge (AS) as biocatalyst. The predominant microbes present in acclimatized AS were identified using Biolog GEN III analysis, which include the electrogenic genera namely Pseudomonas spp. and Bacillus spp, along with methanogenic archea Methanobacterium spp. The mechanism of electron transfer was elucidated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) which clearly demonstrated the natural metabolite-based electron transfer across the electrode/biofilm/solution interface. The abundance of the electron shuttle metabolites was increased with the microbial growth in the bulk solution as well as in the biofilm leading to a high power generation. The COD removal efficiency and the coulombic efficiency (CE) were found to be 40% and 21%, respectively after 11 clays of operation using initial COD of 45,000 mg L-1. The low COD removal efficiency could drastically be increased to 82% when the initial COD of PCW was 5000 mg L-1 generating a power density of 150 mW m(-2). The current work proves the feasibility of the MFC for the treatment of acrylic acid plant PCW using acclimatized anaerobic sludge (AS) as a biocatalyst. (C) 2019 Elsevier BM.

Green synthesis has been used to produce metal nanoparticles using reducing agents drawn from natural sources. In this study, the green synthesis of platinum nanoparticles is using orange peel extract as a bio-reducing agent. The reaction to produce platinum nanoparticles is undertaken in both acidic and alkaline media and has been employed at different selected pH values. The catalyst was physically and electrochemically characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and cyclic voltammetry. The prepared platinum nanoparticles have different distributions at different pH, while the particle size of the platinum remains in the range of 1.6-4.0 nm. The platinum nanoparticles are supported on carbon black for methanol oxidation reaction. The electrochemical analysis reveals that the methanol oxidation peak of the prepared platinum supported on carbon black is at 0.9 V (vs. RHE). The synthesized platinum nanoparticles have strong potential to be used in the methanol oxidation reaction in a DMFC, as they are well distributed, but the nanoparticles need further improvement to be applied in carbon support and alloying to reduce the amount of platinum.","[Karim, N.

This work intends to reveal the applicability of Sengon wood-derived RGO in anchoring/doping iron and nitrogen particles onto its surface and to study its ORR performance in a half-cell environment. Thin-sheet layer and highly defective (I-D/I-G) was gradually obtained at elevated pyrolysis temperature of Sengon wood graphene oxide (GO) at range 700 degrees C to 900 degrees C. As prepared RGO was further doped into catalyst (Fe/N/RGO) through the same pyrolysis procedure at a selected temperature after mixing the GO powder with iron chloride and different nitrogen precursors (urea, choline chloride, and polyaniline) at a fixed ratio.

The economic development of most of these countries relies on fossil fuel price. Nigeria is one of the countries in the world that solely depends on fossil fuels for electricity generation, and this has greatly affected the growth of its power sector. Hence, there is a need for harnessing renewable energy sources (RES) for electricity generation due to its high availability in abundant quantity in the country. In this study, the viability of developing a standalone hybrid RES system using solar and wind for Giri village (Nigeria) is assessed. The techno-economic and environmental analysis was examined using hybrid optimization model for electric renewable (HOMER) simulation tool by selecting the optimum configuration based on cost of energy (COE), net present cost (NPC), renewable fraction (RF), and greenhouse gas emission (GHG). From the obtained results and sensitivity analysis, the optimal configuration has an NPC of $1.01 m and COE $0.110/kWh, with an operating cost of $4723. The system is environmentally friendly with a renewable fraction of 98.3% and GHG emission of 2889.36 kg/year. (C) 2019 The Authors.

An innovative linked anode was designed to enhance the mass transfer of protons and electrons in the scaled-up up-flow membrane-less microbial fuel cell. The common cube anode was used to compare with the linked anode. The performance of voltage output for the cube anode and the linked anode was examined by various hydraulic retention times and the electrode spacing distances. The maximum power density of the linked anode was almost identical at all electrode spacing distances. Meanwhile, this result demonstrated that the configuration of linked anode has better directional fluid flow, mass transfer of protons and electrons, and voltage output (stationary phase) than those of the cube anode at all hydraulic retention times.

Although the flame oxidation technique could improve SS property as electrodes, it comes with an increased risk of corrosion. The undesirable corrosion may cause the release of a toxic element such as chromium. At present, mitigation actions have been identified such as connecting iron to a sacrificial metal in a mechanism known as galvanic corrosion protection (GCP). An external power source could be used as an alternative to supply current similar to the sacrificial metal, which technique applied in MEC. In this review, the electron flow mechanisms between microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) and MEC biocathode will be addressed.

In recent years, solutions-based techniques have attracted great interest due to their advantage in controlling reaction parameters. Among the techniques, amine-based seed-mediated solvothermal growth provides a versatile method for the production of various Pt nanoparticles. However, the amine species that functioned as the stabilizing agent would absorb at the surface of Pt, resulting in poor electrocatalytic performance. For this reason, the amine ligand must be removed in order to reveal the expected catalytic performance of Pt. In this work, we proposed a combination strategy that employed acid treatment under gentle heating followed by thermal treatment to remove the amine ligand and investigate their catalytic effect on formic acid oxidation. The acid wash involved in subjecting the catalyst in acetic acid glacial at 85 degrees C for 1 h + 9 h of heat treatment at 85 degrees C in air atmosphere. The experimental procedures were repeated by subjecting the Pt to 3 h in acetic acid + 7 h of heat treatment, followed by 5 h in acetic acid + 5 h heat treatment and a single treatment by immersing the Pt nanoparticles in acetic acid for 10 h. We reported that this combined activation technique improves significantly the performance of Pt nanoparticles in catalyzing formic acid oxidation. The results showed that 3 h of acid wash + 7 h of thermal treatment is the optimal condition for a high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) value of 1.006 +/- 0.02 m(2)/g, lower coverage of CO adsorption and a steady-state current of 3.03 mA/cm(2) made at 0.67 V (vs. SCE) at 1000 s during formic acid oxidation. This approach could become a potential procedure for activating the Pt surface attached by amine ligand. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Both problems stem from one of its main components, the catalyst. Therefore, this study is focused on determining and optimizing the electrocatalyst parameters of a hig-hperformance DMFC. The electrocatalyst, PtRu/TiO2-CNF, is produced by the deposition method and is subjected to electrochemical measurement and cyclic voltammetry (CV) to measure half-cell performance in a DMFC. The optimization process involved two main phases, a screening process followed by response surface methodology (RSM). The resulting optimum parameters were then used for the single cell performance testing. The results show that the mathematical model suggested by RSM is adequate for the optimization of the parameter levels. The optimum parameters suggested by RSM are a PtRu composition of 30.25% and a catalyst loading of 0.59 mg/cm(2), resulting in almost perfect agreement between the measured current density (603.06 mA/mg(ptRu)) and the predicted value (600.63 mA/mg(ptRu)).

Prolonged exposure of stainless steel to SOFC operating conditions can lead to chromium poisoning owing to migration of chromium (IV) species to cathode and significantly reduces electrical conductivity of cells. Ferritic stainless steel is potential candidate as interconnector because it has appropriate chromium content and is less expensive compared other stainless steels. Protective coating layer on interconnector is essential in minimizing chromium poisoning phenomenon in aspect of area specific resistance (ASR), thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) and coating uniformity. Addition of transition metal to coating layer is an enhanced method to improve coating behavior. Nickel, copper, manganese and silver are promising metals that can be used as coating layer to inhibit chromium (IV) species from diffusing outward and improve electrical conductivity and excellent oxidation resistance. This paper reviews oxidation behavior of coating layer of interconnector of SOFC, sintering effect, protective coating technique and influence of transition metal in the coating layer.

Formic acid concentration (4 M-10 M), temperature (313 K-353 K), anode stoichiometry (1.5-3.0), and cathode stoichiometry (2.0-3.0) are the selected operating parameters in this study. Validation results of the DFAFC are in reasonable agreement with the typical trends reported in the literature on DFAFC performance. Simulation results indicate that formic acid concentration, temperature, anode, and cathode stoichiometry influenced the DFAFC performance and the formic acid crossover. The increments of formic acid concentration or stoichiometric ratio will improve the cell performance; however, the current densities obtained are declining to the increasing temperature. The increase in temperature of the formic acid concentration is found to lead to the decrease in performance. For the formic acid crossover phenomenon, the formic acid crossover flux increases with the increments of formic acid concentration, DFAFC operating temperature, and anode and cathode stoichiometric ratios.

It is also more environmentally benign than conventional power generation systems. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to intermediate-to-low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells, which operating at 400-800 degrees C. Reducing its operating temperature can render SOFC more competitive with other types of fuel cells and portable energy storage system (EES) over a range of applications (eg: transportation, portable, stationary) and more conducive for commercialization. The high-performance composite anode requirements for low operating temperature (400-600 degrees C) demand microstructural and chemical stability, high electronic conductivity, and good electrochemical performance. The current high-temperature anode, Ni-YSZ (nickel-yttria stabilized zirconia) is generally reported with high interfacial resistance at reduced temperatures. This review highlights several potential composite anode materials (Ni-based and Ni-free) that have been developed for low-temperature SOFCs within the past 10 years. This literature survey shows that most of these anodes still exhibit relatively high polarization resistance. Focus is also given on reducing polarization resistance to maintain the cell power density. In literature, common approaches that have been adopted to enhance the performance of anodes are (i) selecting high-performance electrolyte, (ii) exploiting nanopowder properties, and (iii) adding noble metals as electrocatalysts.

This study was conducted to analyse the micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SOFC) in terms of its performance by utilising methane as the fuel, subsequently compared with hydrogen. MT-SOFC that was investigated in this work consisted of thin cathode layer, coated onto co-extruded anode/electrolyte dual-layer hollow fibre (HF); in which its anode was made of nickel (Ni), coupled with cerium-gadolinium oxide (CGO) as an electrolyte, whereas the cathode was lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) and CGO. The physical analyses carried out were three-point bending test and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was further conducted to examine the carbon deposition in HFs. In evaluating the performance of HFs, current-voltage (IV) measurement, as well as impedance analysis of various temperatures range from 500 degrees C to 700 degrees C were performed. Based on the results, the OCV, maximum power density and ohmic ASR of MT-SOFC exposed to methane fuel, were at 0.79 V, 0.22 W cm(-2) and 0.31 Omega cm(2); compared to the other that was exposed to hydrogen fuel, recorded at 0.89 V, 0.67 W cm(-2) and 0.19 Omega cm(2) respectively. This indicates that there was a significant reduction in cell performance when methane was used as the fuel, due to the carbon deposition as proven by SEM, three-point bending and XRD.

This paper presents the design for an HT-PEMFC single-cell test cell with the development of a test station to operate the cell. The single-cell test cell and the real-time monitoring test station were designed using LabVIEW software, and were implemented using NI's cFP hardware devices, the details of which are provided. The architecture of the test station was aimed at measuring and controlling the mass flow rate, pressure and temperature of the reactant gases, and the stack temperature and current. An electronic load, with a quick dynamic response, was used to test the fuel cell reaction. The start-up, shutdown and monitoring functions were managed by the test station, which monitored the critical parameters of the fuel cell, namely, the voltage, current loading, generated power, hydrogen/air inlet and outlet and stack temperature. The results showed that the designed and developed single-cell HT-PEMFC and test station were able to generate power.

This recognition is due to its low construction and operation costs as well as the utilization of microbial metabolism in assisting power generation. One of the most crucial factors contributes to the performance of a biocathode MFC is the characteristics and configuration of the biocathode material itself. Hence it requires improvement for a better understanding towards its bioelectrochemical mechanisms as well as improving the MFC performance. However, reports on improving biocathode through support material selection and performance optimization in MFCs are still lacking. Based on previous reports, studies have shown that carbon-based material and stainless steel are possible biocathode materials for high power MFC performance. This review focuses on comparing these potential biocathode materials, regarding the commonly applied biocathode MFC designs and optimization. This review also compares the performance of biocathode materials in MFC based on the bioelectricity production and wastewater treatment.

In this study, 3-dimensional graphene (3DG)/glucose oxidase (GOx) bio-nanocomposite was fabricated in order to improve enzyme immobilisation and enzyme lifetime with an enhanced electron transfer rate. These enhancements are due to the unique physical properties of 3DG, e.g. high porosity, large surface area, and excellent electrical conductivity. A power density of 164 mu W cm(-2) at 0.4 V was achieved from this enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) with an acceptable performance compared to that of the other glucose biofuel cells (GBFCs). The 3DG enhances the enzyme lifetime, decreases enzyme leaking and, due to its good conductivity, facilitates the electron harvest and transfer from the enzyme active site to the electrode.

The N-CX samples are prepared using resorcinol - formaldehyde resin as the carbon precursor and dicyandiamide as the nitrogen precursor. The N-CX samples carbonized at different temperatures are inspected to interpret the effect of the high-temperature conditions towards the structures and ORR activity of the final products. As-prepared N-CX samples with different carbonized temperatures are characterized via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffractometry and Raman spectroscopy. The N-CX sample carbonized at 800 degrees C demonstrated the greatest ORR activity, and the structural properties and catalytic activities of the catalyst are then further improved by insertion of cobalt metal under an ammonia atmosphere. Metal doping evidently promotes the catalytic activity of the N-CX catalyst. Raman and XPS studies show that cobalt increases the creation of pyridinic-N and quaternary-N groups through the formation of more graphitic structures. The ammonia atmosphere is demonstrated to act as an additional N source by increasing the total N content in the carbon structure after high temperature treatment of the N-CX catalyst. Metal-N-like and metal carbide configurations generated play a role in catalyst production with high catalytic activity. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Novel covalently supported dual acidic IL membranes were prepared by radiation induced grafting of 4-vinyl pyridine (4-VP) onto poly(ethylene-co-tetrafluoroethylene) (ETFE) film followed by post-functionalization via sequential treatments with 1,4-butane sultone and sulfuric acid to introduce pyridinium alkyl sulfonate/hydrogen sulfate moieties. The advantage of our approach lies in grafting polymers with highly reactive functional groups suitable for efficient post-sulfonation. The membranes displayed better swelling and mechanical properties compared to Nafion 112 despite having more than 3 times higher ion exchange capacity (IEC). The proton conductivity reached superior values to Nafion above 80 degrees C. Particularly, the membrane with ion exchange capacity of 3.41 displayed a proton conductivity of 259 mScm(-1) at 95 degrees C. This desired conductivity value is attributed to the high IEC of the membranes as well as dissociation of the hydrophobic ETFE polymer and hydrophilic pyridinium alkyl sulfonate groups. Such appealing properties make the supported IL membranes promising for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC).

This paper reports a new research approach to discover bioelectrochemical reaction kinetics, biodegradation pathways, and electrochemical reaction mechanisms of degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) in MFC, which was inoculated with industrial and domestic microbial consortia, referred to as iMFC and dMFC systems, respectively. The chlorophenol degradation was found to contribute electronic transfer and generation in MFC. Microbial growth and degradation kinetic results analyzed by Michaelis-Menten and Hanes-Woolf models showed that MFC is highly capable of degrading 2,4-DCP at high concentration (>30 mg/L). The biodegradation pathways and metabolites varied significantly in iMFC and dMFC under aerobic/anaerobic conditions. The dMFC demonstrated simple and complete degradation pathways, while complex pathways with more nondegraded metabolites were determined in iMFC. A higher biodegradation rate (>60%, V-max = 0.32 mg/L/h and V-max/K-s = 0.03 h(-1)) was achieved in dMFC, producing less toxic acetate as the final product.

Microalgae, a renewable biomass source, has been proposed as a promising feedstock to generate biofuels due to their fast growth rate with high lipid content. However, literatures have indicated that sustainable production of microalgae biofuels are only viable with a highly optimized production system. In the present study, a cradle-to-gate approach was used to provide expedient insights on the effect of different cultivation systems and biomass productivity toward life cycle energy (LCEA), carbon balance (LCCO2) and economic (LCC) of microalgae biodiesel production pathways. In addition, a co-production of bioethanol from microalgae residue was proposed in order to improve the economic sustainability of the overall system. The results attained in the present work indicated that traditional microalgae biofuels processing pathways resulted to several shortcomings, such as dehydration and lipid extraction of microalgae biomass required high energy input and contributed nearly 21 to 30% and 39 to 57% of the total energy requirement, respectively. Besides, the microalgae biofuels production system also required a high capital investment, which accounted for 47 to 86% of total production costs that subsequently resulted to poor techno-economic performances. Moreover, current analysis of environmental aspects of microalgae biorefinery had revealed negative CO2 balance in producing microalgae biofuels. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Main interesting insights are that at CTC of 0.5 and 0.2 for anode and cathode respectively, the operating voltage at 1 A/cm(2) (current density) is around 2.0 V, however at CTC of 2 and 0.5 for anode and cathode respectively, there was significant drop in operating voltage up to 1.62 V with current density of 1 A/cm(2), this accounts for about 27% reduction in operating voltage. It was also discovered that with exchange current density of 1 x 10-7 for a Pt-Ir anode based electrode the CTC value for anode increase from 0.27 to 0.34 at current density of 0.05 A/cm2 to 2 A/cm2 respectively, whereas for Pt cathode catalyst with exchange current density of 1.8 x 10-3 the CTC values for cathode increased from 0.02 to 0.14 at current density of 0.1 A/cm2 to 2 A/cm2 respectively, these findings were in agreement with the CTC values reported in the literature.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of applying these nanofluids coolants as an alternative to conventional distilled water through detailed analysis of thermofluids behaviour in a simulated cooling plate environment. SiO2 nanoparticles were dispersed in distilled water at 0.1%, 0.3% and 0.5% volume concentrations and tested in a parallel channel cooling plate system. A constant heat load was supplied to simulate a fuel cell stack thermal condition. At inlet flow conditions from 750 to 900 Reynolds number, the SiO2 nanofluids reduced the average plate temperatures by 15%-20% compared to conventional water coolant. The nanofluids also increased the cooling effectiveness by a similar margin, as well as improving the bulk heat transfer coefficient to a range between 2700 and 4400 W m(-2). degrees C-1. However, the required pumping power was also increased due to the added viscous effect. Through the Advantage Ratio (AR) analysis, it was concluded that the enhancement in heat transfer mechanics was more significant than the penalties in fluid flow dynamics. Thus, the SiO2 nanofluids and the cooling plate design are possible options for advanced PEM fuel cell thermal management practice in future stack designs. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Hence, the present work deals with the unsteady bionanofluid flow, heat and mass transfer past an impermeable stretching/shrinking sheet. The appropriate similarity solutions transform the boundary layer equations with three independent variables to a system of ordinary differential equations with one independent variable. The finite difference coupled with the Richardson extrapolation technique in the Maple software solves the reduced system, numerically. The rate of heat transfer is found to be higher when the flow is decelerated past a stretching sheet.

We report for the first time the bias voltage (40 V and 120 V) dependent structural and morphological evolution of YSZ thin films grown via radio frequency magnetron sputtering (RFMS) technique. The optimum sample was annealed at 600 degrees C to achieve an improved ionic conductivity. As-prepared YSZTFs were characterized using various analytical tools. Glancing angle x-ray diffraction (GAXRD) pattern of YSZTFs revealed the existence of non-columnar structure (cubic phases) with preferred growth along [200] lattice orientation. YSZTFs grown at 120 V displayed good homogeneity and uniformity (100 nm thick and crystallite size in the range of 10-12 nm) accompanied by large microstrain along [111] lattice orientation. The bias voltage dependent alterations in the morphology of YSZTFs (grain compactness, size, shape, distribution and surface roughness) were clearly manifested in the FESEM and AFM images. Raman and FTIR spectra of YSZTFs disclosed the formation of tetragonal and cubic phases. An in-depth data analyses suggested the successful incorporation of Yttria into the zirconia lattice. Annealed film exhibited improved polycrystallinity and evolved morphology. These achieved YSZTFs could be effective electrolyte for low temperature SOFC operation.","[Rusli, N.

A promising technology for H-2 purification from carbon dioxide (CO2) is by pressure swing adsorption (PSA) using palm kernel shell activated carbon. The adsorbent exhibited higher affinity for CO2 than H-2. The adsorption system was capable of achieving H-2 purity of almost 100% with H-2 recovery of 88.43%. H-2 contributed 6.62 J.min(-1) of the energy requirement from the total energy of 6.63 J.min(-1) as a result of pressurization of the gas at 3 bar. H-2 contributed 5.85 J.min(-1) energy from depressurization of the gas to 1.5 bar.

However, inadequate outcomes, mainly regarding their electrical performance, have limited their significant potential. Hence, this study proposed the use of multiple fillers, with different geometries, in order to improve the electrical conductivity of a polymer composite. The fabricated composite was mixed, using the ball milling method, before being compressed by a hot press machine at 3 MPa for 10 min. The composite plate was then measured for both its in-plane and through-plane conductivities, which were 3.3 S/cm, and 0.79 S/cm, respectively. Furthermore, the experimental data were then verified using a predicted electrical conductivity model, known as a modified fibre contact model, which considered the manufacturing process, including the shear rate and flow rate. The study indicated that the predicted model had a significant trend and value, compared to the experimental model (0.65 S/cm for sample S1). The resultant fabricated composite materials were found to possess an excellent network formation, and good electrical conductivity for bipolar plate application, when applying compression pressure of 3 MPa for 10 min.","[Radzuan, Nabilah Afiqah Mohd; Sulong, Abu Bakar] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ctr Mat Engn & Smart Mfg MERCU, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Hui, David] Univ New Orleans, Dept Mech Engn, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA; [Verma, Anil] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Chem Engn, New Delhi 110016, India","Sulong, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ctr Mat Engn & Smart Mfg MERCU, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",abubakar@ukm.edu.my,,"Sulong, Abu Bakar/0000-0003-4637-1758","Centre of Research and Instrumentation Management (CRIM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE)Ministry of Education, Malaysia [MI-2019-022, DIP-2017-001]","This research was funded by Centre of Research and Instrumentation Management (CRIM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia and Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE) and grant number MI-2019-022 and DIP-2017-001.",,50,0,0,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4360,,POLYMERS-BASEL,Polymers,SEP,2019,11,9,,,,,,,1425,10.3390/polym11091425,,,12,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,JC2JW,WOS:000489104300051,31480276,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,1/2/2021,

The effects of first- and second-order velocity slips, thermal slip, mass slip, and gyro-tactic (torque-responsive) microorganism slip of bioconvective nanofluid flow from a moving plate under blowing phenomenon are numerically examined. The flow model is expressed by partial differential equations which are converted to a similar boundary value problem by similarity transformations. The boundary value problem is converted to a system of nonlinear equations which are then solved by a Matlab nonlinear equation solver fsolve integrated with a Matlab ODE solver ode15s. The effects of selected control parameters (first order slip, second order slip, thermal slip, microorganism slip, blowing, nanofluid parameters) on the non-dimensional velocity, temperature, nanoparticle volume fraction, density of motile micro-organism, skin friction coefficient, heat transfer rate, mass flux of nanoparticles and mass flux of microorganisms are analyzed. Our analysis reveals that a higher blowing parameter enhances micro-organism propulsion, flow velocity and nano-particle concentration, and increases the associated boundary layer thicknesses. A higher wall slip parameter enhances mass transfer and accelerates the flow. The MATLAB computations have been rigorously validated with the second-order accurate finite difference Nakamura tri-diagonal method. The current study is relevant to microbial fuel cell technologies which combine nanofluid transport, bioconvection phenomena and furthermore can be applied in nano-biomaterials sheet processing systems.","[Uddin, Md Jashim] Amer Int Univ Bangladesh, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Kabir, Muhammad N.] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Comp Syst & Software Engn, Gambang 26300, Pahang, Malaysia; [Alginahi, Yasser] Univ Windsor, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Windsor, ON, Canada; [Beg, O.

Catalytic activity was examined by CV and LSV, while the properties of the catalysts were characterized by FESEM-EDX, N-2 adsorption-desorption, XRD and FTIR. The results showed that the distribution of metals on the carbon surface, carbon wall thickness and the interaction between ionomer and coupled catalysts affected the ORR performance. The fabricated membrane electrode assembly with 5:95 PBI: 30 wt% Pt-Pd/C catalyst ratio exhibited the Pt-best performance and highest durability for HT-PEMFC at 170 degrees C, yielding a power density of 1.30 Wcm(-2) with 0.02 mg(Pt)/cm Pt loading.

It is found that uniform 3 nm spherical-like Pt nano-forms were adhered homogeneous on the surface of Ti0.7W0.3O2. Intriguingly, the electrochemical surface area of Pt catalyst supported on mesoporous Ti0.7W0.3O2 was found to be around 90.05 m(2)/gPt, which is profoundly higher than ECSA value obtained from Pt/C (E-TEK) catalyst. Furthermore, as for methanol oxidation reaction measurement, the I-f/I-b ratio of the 20 wt % Pt/Ti0.7W0.3O2 catalyst was found to be approximately 2.33, which 2.5-folds higher than that of the commercial Pt/C (E-TEK) catalyst.

Furthermore, the modified chemical reduction route utilized to prepare the 20 wt % Pt/Ti0.9Ir0.1O2 electrocatalyst exhibited the good anchoring and uniform distribution of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) (similar to 3 nm) over Ti0.9Ir0.1O2 surface and thus eventually resulted in the high electrochemical surface area (similar to 85.08 m(2)/gPt) compared to that of the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C (E-TEK) catalyst (similar to 69.21 m(2)/gPt). The cyclic voltammetry results in the methanol media revealed that the 20 wt % Pt/Ti0.9Ir0.1O2 displayed the superior electrocatalytic activity compared to the 20 wt % Pt/C (E-TEK) catalyst towards the methanol electro-oxidation. For instance, the 20 wt % Pt/Ti0.9Ir0.1O2 catalyst possessed the higher oxidation current density (similar to 28.8 mA/cm(2)), the lower onset potential (similar to 0.12 V) and the higher If/Ib ratio in comparison with the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C (E-TEK) catalysts. It is worth noting that the chronoamperometry results also indicated that the 20 wt % Pt/Ti0.9Ir0.1O2 exhibited higher durability than the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C (E-TEK) catalyst. Beside introducing novel Ti0.9Ir0.1O2 material, these results also offer a pathway of exploring the low dopants content of TixIr1-xO2 material to serve as a good catalyst support for many fuel cell applications.

In this study, a low cost, good ionic conductivity and low ethanol permeability of an anion exchange membrane based on incorporation KOH-doped quaternized poly(vinyl alcohol) (QPVA) membrane (designed as QPVA/KOH) is synthesized and cross-linked with glutaraldehyde solution. The membrane is expected to cut the production cost and enhance the performance. In this work, an optimum of alkali-doped concentration has influence the membrane performance. The membrane has reveal high chemical stability even doped with 8-M KOH solution in 100 degrees C. The morphology of membranes remained unbreakable and achieved high range of ionic conductivity (similar to 10(-2) S cm(-1)). The membranes present maximum ionic conductivity 1.29 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 30 degrees C and 3.07 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 70 degrees C. The ethanol permeability of membrane is lower compared with the commercial membranes. Power density of alkaline DEFCs with platinum-based catalyst by using cross-linked QPVA/KOH membrane is 5.88 mW cm(-2), which is higher than commercial membranes at 30 degrees C temperature. At 70 degrees C, power density has increased up to 11.28 mW cm(-2) and significantly increased up to 22.82 mW cm(-2) via the nonplatinum-based catalyst. Moreover, according to the durability test, the performance of passive alkaline DEFC by using cross-linked QPVA/KOH membrane has maintained at 36.2% level. With such efficiency, the stack current density has been able to stay above 120 mA cm(-2) for over 1000 hours, at 70 degrees C.","[Shaari, Norazuwana; Kamarudin, Siti Kartom; Zakaria, Zulfirdaus] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Kamarudin, Siti Kartom] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Chem & Proc Engn, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia","Kamarudin, SK (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",ctie@ukm.edu.my; zulfirdauszakaria@gmail.com,"Zakaria, Zulfirdaus/N-7641-2018","Zakaria, Zulfirdaus/0000-0003-3292-8009; shaari, norazuwana/0000-0002-6900-9973",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia [MI -2018 -006],"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Grant/Award Number: MI -2018 -006",,72,11,11,9,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0363-907X,1099-114X,,INT J ENERG RES,Int.

Power-producing systems generally add to the carbon load in the environment, contributing to global climate change. In photosynthesis, energy from light splits water molecules into oxygen, protons, and electrons. Algal biophotovoltaic (BPV) platforms were developed to harvest these electrons to generate bioelectricity through algal photosynthesis. Irradiance is one of the most important parameters that determine power output efficiency from algal BPV devices. In this study, the effective range of irradiance levels for power generation from algal BPV devices comprising of suspension and alginate-immobilized Chlorella cultures on ITO anodes was determined. Immobilized cultures were prepared by entrapping the algal cells in 2% sodium alginate solution. The algal BPV devices were illuminated by four different irradiance levels (30, 90, 150, and 210 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). The maximum power density of 0.456 mW m(-2) was generated from the prototype algal fuel cell at the irradiance level of 150 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). At 210 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), low power density was produced due to photoinhibition as indicated by F-v/F-m values generated through PAM fluorometry. In terms of carbon fixation rate, the highest value was recorded in immobilized culture at 217.11 mg CO2 L-1 d(-1). The algal biophotovoltaic device is multifunctional and can provide sustainable energy with simultaneous carbon dioxide removal.","[Cheng-Han Thong; Siew-Moi Phang; Ng, Fong-Lee] Univ Malaya, IOES, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Cheng-Han Thong; Line, Tau-Chuan] Univ Malaya, Fac Sci, Inst Biol Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Periasam, Vengadesh] Univ Malaya, LDMRC, Dept Phys, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Yunus, Kamran; Fisher, Adrian C.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem Engn & Biotechnol, Cambridge, England","Phang, SM; Ng, FL (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, IOES, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",phang@um.edu.my; fonglee_ng@yahoo.com,"Ng, Fong Lee/V-2267-2017; PERIASAMY, VENGADESH/B-9993-2010; Phang, Siew Moi/A-7653-2008","Thong, Cheng Han/0000-0001-6778-6739",Newton Prize 2017 [IF008-2018]; HICoE MOHE Phase 2 [IOES-2019-2021]; UM Algae [GA003-2012]; IOES UMCoE RU [RU009B-2018],"Newton Prize 2017, Grant/Award Number: IF008-2018; IOES UMCoE RU, Grant/Award Number: RU009B-2018; HICoE MOHE Phase 2, Grant/Award Number: IOES-2019-2021; UM Algae, Grant/Award Number: GA003-2012",,60,6,6,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2050-0505,,,ENERGY SCI ENG,Energy Sci.

The aim is to analyze the fundamental characteristics through experimental works and obtain a steady-state model of the system under the scenario of a mini hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. A test bench was developed consisting of a 2 kW open-cathode PEM fuel cell and a single TEG. A thermal resistance network model was also developed and validated. The main variables were the TEG cooling modes and orientation of the TEG towards the heat flow. At 37 degrees C waste heat temperature, the highest voltage and power output of 25.7 mV and 218 mW respectively were obtained via forced convection cooling and normal flow orientation. The results obtained are unique as it positively showed that the combined use of TEG, heat pipe and heat sink on a vehicle would offset the ultra-low waste heat temperature from a PEM fuel cell. Successful characterization of this system and validation of the model would also allow the system to be further developed for higher performance and contribute to sustainability of PEM fuel cell systems.

The high internal resistance is due to the small surface area of the anode and cathode electrodes following membrane biofouling and pH splitting conditions as well as substrate and oxygen crossover through the membrane pores by diffusion. To address this issue, the fabrication of new PEM air-cathode single-chamber MFC configuration was investigated with inner channel flow open assembled with double PEM air cathodes (two oxygen reduction activity zones) coupled with spiral-anode MFC (2MA-CsS-AMFC). The effect of various proton-exchange membranes (PEMs), including Nafion 117 (N-117), Nafion 115 (N-115), and Nafion 212 (N-212) with respective thicknesses of 183, 127, and 50.08 mu, was separately incorporated into carbon cloth as PEM air-cathode electrode to evaluate their influences on the performance of the 2MA-CsS-AMFC configuration operated in fed-batch mode, while Azorubine dye was selected as the recalcitrant organic compound. The fed-batch test results showed that the 2MA-CsS-AMFC configuration with PEM N-115 operated at Azorubine dye concentration of 300 mg L-1 produced the highest power density of 1022.5 mW m(-2) and open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.20 V coupled with enhanced dye removal (4.77 mg L h(-1)) compared to 2MA-CsS-AMFCs with PEMs N-117 and N-212 and those in previously published data. Interestingly, PEM 115 showed remarkable reduction in biofouling and pH splitting. Apart from that, mass transfer coefficient of PEM N-117 was the most permeable to oxygen (K-O = 1.72 x 10(-4) cm s(-1)) and PEM N-212 was the most permeable membrane to Azorubine (K-A = 7.52 x 10(-8) cm s(-1)), while PEM N-115 was the least permeable to both oxygen (K-O = 1.54 x 10(-4)) and Azorubine (K-A = 7.70 x 10(-10)). The results demonstrated that the 2MA-CsS-AMFC could be promising configuration for bioenergy recovery from wastewater treatment under various PEMs, while application of PEM N-115 produced the best performance compared to PEMs N-212 and N-117 and those in previous studies of membrane/membrane-less air-cathode single-chamber MFCs that consumed dye wastewater.","[Kardi, Seyedeh Nazanin; Ibrahim, Norahim; Rashid, Noor Aini Abdul] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Sci, Dept Biosci, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Darzi, Ghasem Najafpour] Babol Noshirvani Univ Technol, Fac Chem Engn, Biotechnol Res Lab, Babol Sar 4714871167, Mazandaran, Iran","Kardi, SN (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Sci, Dept Biosci, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",nkseyedeh2@live.utm.my,,,"Ministry of Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [15H98]","The author would like to thank the Ministry of Education Malaysia for providing the Research Universiti Grant (RUG), Vote No. 15H98, to carry out the present research and the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) for the laboratory facilities.",,46,0,0,2,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

The application of biomass in DCFCs will be a major transition from the use of coal to generate energy. However, the relationship between biomass or biochar composition and the electrochemical performance of a DCFC is yet to be studied. The performance of a DCFC using fuel sources derived from woody and non-woody biomass were compared in this study. The effect of pyrolysis temperature ranges from 550 degrees C to 850 degrees C on the preparation of biochar from rubber wood (RW) and rice husk (RH) were evaluated for power generation from DCFCs. In addition, the effect of applying chemical pre-treatment and post-treatment on biochar were further investigated for DCFC performance. In general, the power density derived from rubber wood biochar is significantly higher (2.21 mW cm(-2)) compared to rice husk biochar (0.07 mW cm(-2)). This might be due to the presence of an oxygen functional group, higher fixed carbon content, and lower ash content in rubber wood biochar. The acid and alkaline pre-treatment and post-treatment have altered the composition with a lower ash content in rubber wood biochar. The structural and compositional alterations in alkaline pre-treatment bring a positive effect in enhancing the power density from DCFCs. This study concludes that woody biochar is more suitable for DCFC application, and alkaline pre-treatment in the preparation of biochar enhances the electrochemical activity of DCFC.

The triple layer hollow fiber consisted of electrolyte/active functional layer (AFL)/anode was fabricated by single-step phase-inversion-based co-extrusion technique prior to the sintering process at temperature range of 1400 to 1500 degrees C. The hollow fibers were characterized by three-point bending test, gas tightness test, and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The electrochemical performance test was carried out at temperatures of 700-800 degrees C by flowing fuel at 20 ml/min. Based on the results attained, the gas tightness and bending test are improved by the increase of sintering temperature. SEM results show that the finger-like morphology length around 100 mu m is obtained. In addition, the AFL layer located in the middle layer of the hollow fiber has its own finger like which forms sandwich-like structure with the anode layer. The open circuit voltage is recorded at 1.05 V with the highest power density obtained at 0.6 W cm(-2) by using hydrogen. By changing the fuel into methane gas, the highest power density is achieved at 0.8 W cm(-2). This is due to the methane that carries more hydrogen molecule. This indicates that the methane fuel can be utilized in hollow fiber SOFC systems.","[Mohamed, Mohd Hilmi; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan; Hubadillah, Siti Khadijah; Rahman, Mukhlis A.; Jaafar, Juhana; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia","Othman, MHD (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",dzarfan@utm.my,"Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan/J-8230-2015","Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan/0000-0002-5842-2447","Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under UTM RD Fund [Q.J130000.7746.4J309]; Ministry of Education, Malaysia under Higher Institution Centre of Excellence (HICoE) program [R.J090301.7846.4J194]","This work was financially supported by the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under UTM R&D Fund (Project no.

However, over the time, the anodic biofilm can be particularly detrimental for electrogenesis due to the accumulation of more dead cells and that increases the charge transfer resistance as well as reduces the electrocatalytic efficiency. In this study, flow induced shear stresses (4.38, 9.34 and 14.92 mPa) were employed to revitalize the biofilm by removing the inert biomass for the maintenance of stable power in MFCs. Among them, the moderate shear stress (9.34 mPa) successfully reduced the thickness and thereby revitalized the biofilm within a short time. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and cell viability count analysis of the biofilms confirmed that the shear stress (9.34 mPa) reduced the dead cells accumulation in the biofilm. Moreover, this treatment significantly reduced the polarization resistance (68%) by dislodging nonconductive inert dead cells from the surface. Our results revealed that the application of shear stress could be an effective method to maintain the stable power generation by reducing the thickness and increasing the cell viability of the biofilm in the MFC.","[Islam, M.

The structural, morphological, and electrochemical behaviors of the as-synthesized materials were investigated to determine the applicability of SrFe1-xTixO3-delta as a cobalt-free cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a single-phase cubic perovskite structure. The unit volume of this perovskite structure increased as the amount of Ti dopant increased. Morphological analysis revealed that the porosity of the SrFe1-xTixO3-delta perovskite cathode film was inversely proportional to the amount of Ti dopant. The cathode SrFe0.9Ti0.1O3-delta film exhibited a high porosity of 24.74 +/- 0.52%, a low but acceptable hardness value of 0.70 +/- 0.01 GPa and an area specific resistance of 0.57 Omega cm(2). These results suggested that cobalt-free SrFe1-xTixO3-delta cathode was still not good enough to be compared with the existing cobalt-containing cathode such as lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite. But, the results obtained from this work can be considered as a major turning point as the literature works on SrFe1-xTixO3-delta cathode showed excellence electrochemical performance. The contradict result between the present and past studies proved that the use of SrFe1-xTixO3-delta cathode is worthy of being studied into details to confirm its capability.","[Baharuddin, Nurul Akidah; Aman, Nurul Ashikin Mohd Nazrul; Muchtar, Andanastuti; Somalu, Mahendra Rao; Samat, Abdullah Abdul; Aznam, Muhamad Isyraf] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Muchtar, Andanastuti] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ctr Mat Engn & Smart Mfg MERCU, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Samat, Abdullah Abdul] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Fac Engn Technol, Kampus UniCITI Alam, Padang Besar 02100, Perlis, Malaysia","Muchtar, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",muchtar@ukm.edu.my,"Samat, Abdullah Abdul/F-2544-2018; Aznam, Isyraf I/V-8123-2018","Samat, Abdullah Abdul/0000-0002-9407-6684; Aznam, Isyraf I/0000-0002-9536-8531; Somalu, Mahendra Rao/0000-0003-1667-693X",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) [GGPM-2018-053],This work was supported by the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) with grant number GGPM-2018-053.

The composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer-EmmettTeller (BET) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). From the SEM and TEM; it was found that AuNPs and PEDOT have a uniform distribution on rGO sheets. Meanwhile, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy results confirmed the existence of vibrational and adsorption bond of PEDOT on rGO sheets, while XRD pattern revealed the formation of AuNPs/PEDOT/rGO composite by characteristic of crystallographic structure. The nitrogen adsorption isotherm study indicated that the composites have both mesopores and macropores particle size. The analysis of thermogravimetric showed the synthesized composites are stable, where the decomposition step was below than 400 degrees C with a slightly mass loss. For the fabrication of electrode, the composite's suspension was drop-tasted on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. AuNPs/PEDOT/rGO modified GCE exhibits better electron transfer, good capacitive and control-diffuse behaviour. The electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction was investigated by cyclic voltammetry in the presence of O-2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The results demonstrated that AuNPs/ PEDOT/rGO/GCE has a good response toward catalytic of O-2. Therefore, this work gives support that the AuNPs/ PEDOT/rGO composite has a potential for cathode materials in fuel cells.","[Muhamad, Nurul'ain Basyirah; Yusoff, Farhanini] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Sch Marine & Environm Sci, Kuala Nerus 21030, Terengganu, Malaysia; [Khairul, Wan M.] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Sch Fundamental Sci, Kuala Nerus 21030, Terengganu, Malaysia","Yusoff, F (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Sch Marine & Environm Sci, Kuala Nerus 21030, Terengganu, Malaysia.",farhanini@umt.edu.my,"Zin, Wan Mohd Khairul Wan Mohamed/V-3764-2019; Khairul, Wan M./AAG-4182-2019","Zin, Wan Mohd Khairul Wan Mohamed/0000-0002-7539-5380; ",Ministry of Education Research Acculturation Grant Scheme (RAGS) [1/2015/STO/UMT/03/2]; Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) [FRGS/1/2017/STG01/UMT/02/2]; Universiti Malaysia Terengganu,This work was supported by the Ministry of Education Research Acculturation Grant Scheme (RAGS) 1/2015/STO/UMT/03/2 and Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) FRGS/1/2017/STG01/UMT/02/2 for financial support as well as Universiti Malaysia Terengganu for the providing research facilities in undertaking this research.,,34,3,3,5,38,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0022-4596,1095-726X,,J SOLID STATE CHEM,J.

Here, we report a triple-conducting double perovskite oxide Sr2Sc0.1Nb0.1Co1.5Fe0.3O6 d (SSNCF) as a novel cathode for dual-ion solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). We further report a method based on an oxygen ion blocking technique in combination with a hydrogen permeability test for determining the proton conductivity in SSNCF. The results indicate the triple-conducting (H+| O2 | e ) capability of the perovskite with a Grotthuss mechanism for the proton diffusion. A cell with a thin-film BZCYYb electrolyte and an SSNCF cathode delivered peak power densities (PPDs) of 840 and 732 mW cm 2, respectively, at 650 and 600 C, superior to most other similar cells with different cathodes. Compared with Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 d (BSCF), the non-conflicting oxygen ion and proton diffusion channels in the SSNCF cathode significantly improved the performance of dual-ion SOFCs, where oxygen ions and protons diffuse through oxygen vacancies (vehicle mechanism) and lattice oxygen (Grotthuss mechanism), respectively. This finding highlights the potential to attain further performance enhancements for reduced-temperature SOFCs through the adoption of dual-ion electrolyte and triple-conducting cathode.","[Zhou, Chuan; Song, Yufei; Dai, Jie; Zhang, Junxing; Gu, Binbin; Zhou, Wei; Shao, Zongping] Nanjing Tech Univ, Jiangsu Natl Synerget Innovat Ctr Adv Mat SICAM, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Coll Chem Engn, 30 Pu Zhu Nan Rd, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Sunarso, Jaka] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Res Ctr Sustainable Technol, Jalan Simpang Tiga, Kuching 93350, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Shao, Zongping] Curtin Univ, WASM MECE, Perth, WA 6845, Australia","Zhou, W; Shao, ZP (corresponding author), Nanjing Tech Univ, Jiangsu Natl Synerget Innovat Ctr Adv Mat SICAM, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Coll Chem Engn, 30 Pu Zhu Nan Rd, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Shao, ZP (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, WASM MECE, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",zhouwei1982@njtech.edu.cn; shaozp@njtech.edu.cn,"Shao, Zongping/AAY-8177-2020; , 周嵬/B-1083-2012; Dai, Jie/F-5432-2018","Shao, Zongping/0000-0002-4538-4218; , 周嵬/0000-0003-0322-095X; Dai, Jie/0000-0001-9470-5172","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21576135, 21706129, 21878158]; Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars [BK20170043]; Defense Industrial Technology Development Program [JCKY2018605B006]","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under (No. 21576135, 21706129, 21878158), the Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (No. BK20170043), and the Defense Industrial Technology Development Program (JCKY2018605B006).",,41,14,14,16,81,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2050-7488,2050-7496,,J MATER CHEM A,J.

The simulation with different types of load was performed to compare the performance of the proposed controller with both PI and LQR controllers.

The energy sharing performance was verified through variation in load resistance and disturbances in bus voltage. The voltage recovery time of LQR-PI controller was slightly higher (200 ms) than that of the LQR controller (23.8 ms) and, however, lower than that of the PI controller (300 ms).

Therefore, PtRu catalyst loading needs to be reduced and alternative metal should be added to ensure DMFC performance is maintained. Hence, the main objective of this study was to analyze potential alternative catalysts metals. Four potential catalysts, ferum (Fe), nikle (Ni), aurum (Au) and palladium (Pd) were simulated using computational chemistry.

Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide production through oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a sustainable approach, primarily due to its significance in energy conversion systems such as fuel cells. Low temperature fuel cells use graphite as a cathode for H2O2 synthesis. However, the catalytic activity of a graphite cathode for a two-electron oxygen reduction reaction must be improved. Nitrogen doping is an efficient approach to modify the electrochemically active surface of the graphite cathode. Therefore, quantum chemical approaches are essential to comprehend the molecular nature of the processes at the cathode. DFT/B3LYP/6-31G* method was employed and bond dissociation energy (BDE) analysis was performed to determine the feasibility of H2O2 production at graphite and nitrogen-doped graphite (Graphite-N) cathodes. According to the suggested mechanism, oxygen adsorption is the first step of the ORR. Calculated values showed that with energy value of 23.50kcal/mol oxygen adsorption at the Graphite-N cathode is energetically more favorable than the graphite cathode (E-ad=65.08kcal/mol). Considering the ORR mechanism, a second-electron oxygen reduction is identified as a key step for both H2O and H2O2 production. Therefore, BDEs were compared at the second-electron oxygen reduction step. On average, -320.92 and -286.04kcal/mol of BDEs for graphite and Graphite-N cathodes showed the feasibility of H2O2 production at the Graphite-N cathode. The results are in agreement with the literature. Thus, it is concluded that nitrogen doping of the graphite cathode increases the feasibility of H2O2 production.

In this work, we present a simple and efficient method to fabricate highly durable anion exchange membranes from commercial porous hydrocarbon substrates. Polyethylene/polypropylene (PE/PP) microfibers is employed as a substrate and radiation induced emulsion grafting is utilized to introduce poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) side chains. The grafted substrates with flexible content of side chains are converted to anion exchange membranes by converting into dense membranes and introducing quaternary amine groups. The dense membranes are characterized and employed in vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) application. Developed membranes demonstrate high anion conductivity, low vanadium permeability and good chemical and mechanical stability. In compare to Nafion 117, superior performance is achieved for the developed membranes as the undesired vanadium ion permeability is reduced by 16 times and the energy efficiency significantly enhanced by 9% at current density of 80 mA cm(-2). Such enhanced performance of the developed membrane is attributed to the presence of positive charged ionic groups in the membrane structure.","[Abdiani, Majid; Shockravi, Abbas] Kharazmi Univ, Fac Chem, Dept Organ Polymer Chem, 49 Mofatteh Ave, Tehran, Iran; [Abouzari-Lotf, Ebrahim; Nia, Pooria Moozarm; Sha'rani, Saidatul Sophia; Ahmad, Arshad] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Ctr Hydrogen Energy, Adv Mat Res Grp, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia; [Abouzari-Lotf, Ebrahim; Ahmad, Arshad] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Chem Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Ting, Teo Ming] Agensi Nuklear Malaysia, Radiat Technol Div, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Sha'rani, Saidatul Sophia] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Malaysia Japan Int Inst Technol, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia","Shockravi, A (corresponding author), Kharazmi Univ, Fac Chem, Dept Organ Polymer Chem, 49 Mofatteh Ave, Tehran, Iran.; Abouzari-Lotf, E (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Ctr Hydrogen Energy, Adv Mat Res Grp, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia.",ebrahim@utm.my; Abbas_Shockravi@yahoo.co.uk,"TING, Teo Ming/G-2505-2015","TING, Teo Ming/0000-0001-9587-7590; Abouzari-Lotf, Ebrahim/0000-0002-0549-4199","Kharazmi University (Iran); Ministry of Education Malaysia under FRGS; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under FRGS Scheme; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under Research University Fund Scheme [FRGS/1/2018/TKO5/MOSTI/03/1, 17H21]; Iranian National Science Foundation (INSF)Iran National Science Foundation (INSF); Ministry of Education Malaysia under Research University Fund Schemes [FRGS/1/2018/TKO5/MOSTI/03/1, 17H21]",This research was funded by Kharazmi University (Iran) and Ministry of Education Malaysia and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under FRGS and Research University Fund Schemes (vote no.

However, the main problem of DEFCs is the sluggish oxidation of ethanol and fuel crossover from the anode side to the cathode side. Nafion membranes are commonly used as the electrolyte membrane in DEFCs, but they have a high production cost and high ethanol permeability. Thus, this work studies the performance of an alternative electrolyte membrane that is based on a quaternized poly(vinyl alcohol) (QPVA) polymer in passive alkaline DEFCs. The composition of the QPVA-based membranes was optimized with potassium hydroxide (KOH) as an ion charge carrier and by the inorganic filler graphene oxide (GO). The membrane properties were influenced by KOH and GO. The effect of these two parameters on the performance of the QPVA-based membranes was investigated for its ion-exchange capacity and ionic conductivity and selectivity using the response surface methodology to optimize the membrane composition. The QPVA-based membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and field emission scanning electron microscope. The membrane properties were influenced by KOH concentration doping and GO filler loading, which affect the membrane selectivity and, consequently, the overall performance of the passive alkaline DEFCs. Finally, the maximum power density of the passive DEFCs was improved from 5.8 to 11.3 W cm(-2) at 30 degrees C, 13.7 mW cm(-2) at 60 degrees C, and 19.3 mW cm(-2) at 90 degrees C, respectively, in ambient air.

The effects of anisotropic slip, thermal jump and mass slip are considered in the mathematical model. Suitable similarity transformations are used to reduce the partial differential equation system into a nonlinear ordinary differential system. The transformed nonlinear ordinary differential equations with appropriate transformed boundary conditions are solved numerically with the bvp4c procedure in the symbolic software, MATLAB. The mathematical computations showed that an increase in Brownian motion parameter corresponds to a stronger thermophoretic force which encourages transport of nanoparticles from the hot bi-axial sheet to the quiescent fluid. This increases the nanoparticle volume fraction boundary layer. Fluid temperature and thermal boundary layer thickness are decreased with increasing stretching rate ratio of the bi-axial sheet.

Phylogenetic analysis proved the presence of Pseudomonas species and Bacillus subtilis, which actively boosted the electron transfer, in the biofilm. Moreover, three unstructured kinetic models for EB growth, namely the logistic, Kono and Asai (KA), and combined continuous logistic and Fermi (CCLF) models, were proposed and validated. The logistic and KA growth models had high R2 (>0.91) and low root-mean-square error (RMSE) (<1.082) values, while the CCLF model showed low values for both R2 (0.48) and RMSE (5.431).

In a longterm operation, Cr volatilization causes Cr poisoning on the cathode component, which is in contact with the SUS430 interconnect. La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (iscF) cathode is currently the best candidate for IT-SOFC cathode. This study aims to determine the effects of the long-term oxidation of SUS430 steel on volatile Cr species formation and to investigate the influence of Cr volatilization on the LSCF cathode performance. The results show that the oxidation of SUS430 steel for 200 h parabolically increased its weight due to oxide scale formation. The scale consists of two layers, namely, the spinel on top and the chromia layer, which does not affect the SUS430 conductivity. However, Cr deposition on the LSCF cathode surface causes the formation of SrCrO4 and Cr2O3 crystallites. This phenomenon reduces the catalytic activity and increases the electrical resistance and the activation energy due to the high amount of oxygen vacancies. Therefore, the mitigation of volatile Cr species is important in maintaining the long-term stability of IT-SOFCs.","[Aznam, Isyraf; Wen, Joelle Mah Chia; Muchtar, Andanastuti; Baharuddin, Nurul Akidah; Somalu, Mahendra Rao] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Sel Fuel, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Muchtar, Andanastuti; Ghazali, Mariyam Jameelah] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fak Kejuruteraan & Alam Bina, Pusat Kejuruteraan Bahan & Pembuatan Pintar, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia","Muchtar, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Sel Fuel, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.; Muchtar, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fak Kejuruteraan & Alam Bina, Pusat Kejuruteraan Bahan & Pembuatan Pintar, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",muchtar@ukm.edu.my,"Aznam, Isyraf I/V-8123-2018; ghazali, mariyam/AAH-7795-2019","Aznam, Isyraf I/0000-0002-9536-8531; ",,,,45,2,2,0,6,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,SELANGOR,"FACULTY SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, BANGI, SELANGOR, 43600, MALAYSIA",0126-6039,,,SAINS MALAYS,Sains Malays.,APR,2019,48,4,,,,,861,869,,10.17576/jsm-2019-4804-18,,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,HX7NN,WOS:000467592200018,,"Bronze, Green Accepted",,,1/2/2021,

This work describes for the first time how PEMFC performance can be enhanced, while using relatively low temperature processing for the MEA, by choosing the suitable solvent and suitable ionomer (nafion) content. Three dispersion solvents (water, ethylene glycol and ethanol) have been examined here, and ethanol (with lowest boiling point) showed best PEMFC performance. In addition to its non-hazardous nature, the low boiling point ethanol allowed manufacturing the working membrane at 130 degrees C or lower besides using a safe solvent to use. In each solvent system, different nafion concentrations were used (10%, 20% and 30%).The 30% nafion concentration in ethanol showed highest performance (Open circuit potential of 0.88 V and output working potential of 0.67 V at 20 mA/cm(2) current density) among the series. The anode and cathode, of the MEA, were both fabricated using same catalyst material (Platinum) and same nafion sheet thickness (50 mu m). The spray method was employed.

Results revealed that the charge transfer process associated with the incorporation of O2- ions and the surface oxygen reduction reaction rate are dependent on CFL and CCL thicknesses, respectively. Area-specific resistance is dependent on CCL thickness in high-frequency arcs and on CFL thickness in low-frequency arcs. No significant change was observed in area-specific resistance value as the thickness of LSCF CCL decreased (25-5m) while the LSCF-SDC CFL thickness (5-25m) was gradually increased. However, the LSCF-SDC composite cathode (without CCL) showed poor catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction and had a high area-specific resistance value (3.31cm(2)). When LSCF CCL (5m) was used, the area-specific resistance value decreased by 16 times relative to the ASR of a sample without CCL. The field emission scanning electron microscopy results indicated that these cathodes exhibited a clear change in microstructure on the surface of the LSCF CCL after 100h of thermal treatment in oxygen. The particle agglomeration and Sr surface segregation affected the surface catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction at the LSCF CCL. As a result, the ASR value increased gradually in100 h thermal treatment.","[Ali, S. A.

X-ray diffraction results confirmed that the sintered electrolytes possessed a cubic fluorite crystal structure. However, a perovskite secondary phase (SrCeO3) was observed in Ce0.8Er0.125Sr0.075O2-delta co-doped composition due to the low solubility limit of strontium (similar to 5 mol%) in ceria. UV-Vis spectroscopy showed that the co-doping of strontium from 0 mol% to 7.5 mol% increased the direct band gap from 3.41 eV to 3.43 eV. The relative densities and the grain size were in the range of 96.02-97.68% and 1.5-3.28 mu m, respectively, with increasing the strontium content from 0 mol% to 7.5 mol%.

The sintering properties of cerium gadolinium oxide (CGO) electrolyte were studied by comparing two approaches: i) using mixed particle size electrolyte; and (ii) adding lithium oxide as sintering additive in electrolyte. When comparing the maximum power density of MT-SOFC namely nickel (Ni)-CGO/CGO (unmodified), Ni-CGO/30%nano-70%micron CGO (first approach) and Ni-CGO/lithium (Li)-CGO (second approach); it was found that the Ni-CGO/30%nano-70%micron CGO cell performed the best. At 500 degrees C, the cell produced the highest maximum power density, which was 27.5 mWcm(-2) as compared to Ni-CGO/Li-CGO cell (6 mWcm(-2)) and Ni-CGO/CGO cell (20 mWcm(-2)). The high maximum power density was attributed to the porous anode in Ni-CGO/30%nano-70%mic CGO dual layer hollow fiber which provided higher number of active reaction sites. Meanwhile, the dense electrolyte layer possessed pore filling caused by the introduction of 30% nano size CGO particles which reduced the direct flow of gases between the electrodes.

Ethanol crossover was indicated by the carbon dioxide (CO2)( ) concentration present at the cathode outlet and measured by using a CO2 analyzer. Results indicated that DEFC performance increased with the increase of ethanol concentration, and ethanol and oxidant flow rate increased with temperature until DEFC reaches the optimum conditions, i.e., concentration and flow rate.

Furthermore, fuel crossover, that is, ethanol flux, increased in proportion to the ethanol concentration, i.e., 3.71 x 10(-4) g m(- 2) s(-1) and 8.79 x 10(-4) g m(-2) S-1 for 0.5 M and 3.0 M ethanol concentration, respectively. At different modes of operation, the active DEFC system exhibited the highest performance, followed by the semi passive and passive DEFC system. These results indicated that optimizing ethanol, oxidant flow rate and temperature would enhance the mass transport in anodes and cathodes, and hence improve the electrochemical reactions and DEFC performance.

In the present study, 3D-scaffold was fabricated using nanocrystalline forsterite powder in polymer sponge method. The FU scaffold was used in investigating the physicochemical, biomechanics, cell attachment, in vitro biocompatibility and osteogenic differentiation properties. For physicochemical characterisation, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Xray photoemission spectrometer (XPS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) were used. FTIR, EDX, XRD peaks and Raman spectroscopy demonstrated correlating to FU. The XPS confirmed the surface chemistry associating to FU. The BET revealed FU scaffold surface area of 12.67 m(2)/g and total pore size of 0.03 cm(3)/g. Compressive strength of the FU scaffold was found to be 27.18 +/- 13.4 MPa. The human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) characterisation prior to perform seeding on FU scaffold verified the stromal cell phenotypic and lineage commitments. SEM, confocal images and presto blue viability assay suggested good cell attachment and proliferation of hBMSCs on FU scaffold and comparable to a commercial bone substitutes (cBS). Osteogenic proteins and gene expression from day 7 onward indicated FU scaffold had a significant osteogenic potential (p < 0.05), when compared with day 1 as well as between FU and cBS. These findings suggest that FU scaffold has a greater potential for use in orthopaedic and/or orthodontic applications.","[Krishnamurithy, Genasan; Mohan, Saktiswaren; Mansor, Azura; Murali, Malliga Raman; Raghavendran, Hanumantha Rao Balaji; Kamarul, Tunku] Univ Malaya, Dept Orthopaed Surg NOCERAL, Fac Med, TEG, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Krishnamurithy, Genasan] Inst Translat Med, Dept Mol & Clin Canc Med, Musculoskeletal Res Grp, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Yahya, Noor Azlin] Univ Malaya, Fac Dent, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Choudhary, Rajan; Sasikumar, Swamiappan] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Adv Sci, Dept Chem, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India","Krishnamurithy, G; Kamarul, T (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Orthopaed Surg NOCERAL, Fac Med, TEG, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.; Krishnamurithy, G (corresponding author), Inst Translat Med, Dept Mol & Clin Canc Med, Musculoskeletal Res Grp, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",veda_g82@hotmail.com; tkzrea@ummc.edu.my,"Sasikumar, S./M-9921-2016; Choudhary, Rajan/R-7998-2018; Genasan, Krishnamurithy/AAK-1277-2020; Abidin, Tunku Kamarul Zaman Tunku Zainol/B-9633-2011; genasan, krishnamurithy/M-4049-2018","Sasikumar, S./0000-0003-2533-4923; Abidin, Tunku Kamarul Zaman Tunku Zainol/0000-0002-6028-1313; Choudhary, Rajan/0000-0001-6370-8071","University of Malaya Research Grant (UM RG) [RPOO5B-13HTM]; University of Malaya Postgraduate Research Grant [PPP-PG208-20146]; Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) [FRGS-FP016]; Ministry of Higher EducationScience and Technology Development Fund (STDF)Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR) [RPOO5B-13HTM, PG208-2014B]; Institute of post graduate dual PhD funding; Bright sparks scheme, University of Malaya","This work was supported by: TK, RPOO5B-13HTM, University of Malaya Research Grant (UM RG) (https://www.um.edu.my); by TK, PPP-PG208-20146, University of Malaya Postgraduate Research Grant (https://www.um.edu.ma); and by AM, FRGS-FP016, Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) (https://mastic.mosti.gov.my).

This system also integrates the stationary supply for electric and hydrogen cars. The polygeneration system is developed based on energy, economic and environment simulation models by taking into account its application for the residential building. Four system configurations were designed based on the grid connection and the vehicle type and subsequently evaluated to determine the performance of the system in regard to the criteria such as efficiency, reliability, primary energy saving, cost saving as well as carbon dioxide reduction. Moreover, a strategy of selling the available hydrogen was also considered to analyze the competitiveness of the proposed system with the conventional separated system. Depending on these criteria, analysis of fuel cell size with respect to the coverage of demands was also conducted. The proposed system achieved primary energy savings, cost saving and emission reduction of about 73%, 50% and 70% respectively. The hydrogen selling strategy has a significant effect in reducing energy cost close to 51% for the configuration with electric vehicle station.","[Ramadhani, Farah; Hussain, M.

It comprised a feedback loop control that utilized the differential temperatures of the oxidation and reduction zones in the gasifier to determine the regional heat-flow (endothermic or exothermic), to assess the availability of oxidizing agent (for instance, air or O-2) at the char bed and to calculate the fuel feeding rate. Based on the correlations developed, the air-to-fuel ratio or the equivalence air ratio (ER) for air gasification could be instantaneously adjusted to maintain stable operation of the gasifier. This study demonstrated a simplification of complex reaction dynamics in the gasification process to differential temperature profiling of the gasifier. The monitoring and control system was tested for more than 70 h of continuous operation in a downdraft fixed-bed gasifier with refuse-derived fuel (RDF) prepared from municipal solid wastes (MSW). With the system, fuel feeding rate could be adjusted accurately to stabilize the operating temperature and ER in the gasifier and generate syngas with consistent properties. Significant reductions in the fluctuations of temperature profiles at oxidation and reduction zones (from higher than 100 degrees C to lower than 50 degrees C), differential temperatures (from +/- 200 to +/- 50 degrees C) in gasifier and the flow rate (from 16 +/- 6.5 to 12 +/- 1.8 L/min), composition of main gas components, LHV (from 6.2 +/- 3.1 to 5.7 +/- 1.6 MJ/Nm3) and tar content (from 8.0 +/- 9.7 to 7.5 +/- 4.2 g/Nm3) of syngas were demonstrated. The developed gasifier monitoring and control system is adaptable to various types (updraft, downdraft, and fluidized-bed) and scales (lab, pilot, large scale) of gasifiers with different types of fuel.","[Chan, Wei Ping; Veksha, Andrei; Lei, Junxi; Oh, Wen-Da; Dou, Xiaomin; Giannis, Apostolos; Lisak, Grzegorz; Lim, Teik-Thye] Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Environm & Water Res Inst, Residues & Resource Reclamat Ctr, 1 Cleantech Loop,Clean Tech One, Singapore 637141, Singapore; [Oh, Wen-Da] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Chem Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Giannis, Apostolos] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, Univ Campus, Khania 73100, Greece; [Lisak, Grzegorz; Lim, Teik-Thye] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Chan, WP; Lim, TT (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Environm & Water Res Inst, Residues & Resource Reclamat Ctr, 1 Cleantech Loop,Clean Tech One, Singapore 637141, Singapore.",wpchan@ntu.edu.sg; cttlim@ntu.edu.sg,"Oh, Wen-Da/X-5294-2019; Chan, Wei Ping/X-2533-2019; Lim, Teik Thye/A-3790-2011; Lisak, Grzegorz/ABC-3061-2020; Lisak, Grzegorz/F-3123-2019","Oh, Wen-Da/0000-0002-1848-7617; Chan, Wei Ping/0000-0001-9490-9351; Lim, Teik Thye/0000-0002-0386-0394; Lisak, Grzegorz/0000-0003-1662-0709","National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, SingaporeSingapore National Research Foundation; National Environment Agency, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore [WTE CRP 1501 105]; Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute; Economic Development Board, SingaporeSingapore Economic Development Board","This research is supported by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore and the National Environment Agency, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore, under the Waste-to-Energy Competitive Research Programme (WTE CRP 1501 105).

Therefore, extensive research is done worldwide to convert glycerol into numerous high added-value chemicals i.e., glyceric acid, 1,2-propanediol, acrolein, glycerol carbonate, dihydroxyacetone, etc. Hydroxyl acids, glycolic acid and lactic acid, which comprise of carboxyl and alcohol functional groups, are the focus of this study. They are chemicals that are commonly found in the cosmetic industry as an antioxidant or exfoliator and a chemical source of emulsifier in the food industry, respectively. The aim of this study is to selectively convert glycerol into these acids in a single compartment electrochemical cell. For the first time, electrochemical conversion was performed on the mixed carbon-black activated carbon composite (CBAC) with Amberlyst-15 as acid catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, conversion of glycerol to glycolic and lactic acids via electrochemical studies using this electrode has not been reported yet. Two operating parameters i.e., catalyst dosage (6.4-12.8% w/v) and reaction temperature [room temperature (300 K) to 353 K] were tested. At 353 K, the selectivity of glycolic acid can reach up to 72% (with a yield of 66%), using 9.6% w/v catalyst. Under the same temperature, lactic acid achieved its highest selectivity (20.7%) and yield (18.6%) at low catalyst dosage, 6.4% w/v.","[Lee, Ching Shya; Daud, Wan Ashri Wan] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Lee, Ching Shya; Cognet, Patrick; Peres, Yolande] Univ Toulouse, Lab Genie Chim, INP, CNRS,UPS, Toulouse, France; [Aroua, Mohamed Kheireddine] Sunway Univ, CCDCU, Sch Sci & Technol, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia; [Aroua, Mohamed Kheireddine] Univ Lancaster, Dept Engn, Lancaster, England; [Ajeel, Mohammed A.] Al Karkh Univ Sci, Dept Chem, Baghdad, Iraq","Lee, CS (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.; Lee, CS (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, Lab Genie Chim, INP, CNRS,UPS, Toulouse, France.; Aroua, MK (corresponding author), Sunway Univ, CCDCU, Sch Sci & Technol, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia.; Aroua, MK (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Engn, Lancaster, England.",leecs@um.edu.my; kheireddinea@sunway.edu.my,"Ajeel, Mohammed A/M-3769-2016; Lee, Ching Shya/O-1008-2013; Aroua, Mohamed Kheireddine/B-9037-2010","Ajeel, Mohammed A/0000-0003-0900-7703; Lee, Ching Shya/0000-0001-5358-9013; Aroua, Mohamed Kheireddine/0000-0002-9388-5439",Center for Separation Science and Technology at University of Malaya; Laboratoire de Genie Chimique at Campus INP-ENSIACET; Federation INCREASE; Fundamental Research Grant Scheme from the Ministry of Education (Department of Higher Education) [FP046-2017A],"We thankful for the support of the Center for Separation Science and Technology at University of Malaya, the Laboratoire de Genie Chimique at Campus INP-ENSIACET, the Federation INCREASE.

This process requires an efficient electrocatalyst with high faradaic efficiency at low overpotential and enhanced reaction rate. Herein, we report an innovative way of reducing CO2 using copper-metal supported on titanium oxide nanotubes (TNT) electrocatalysts. The TNT support material was synthesized using alkaline hydrothermal process with Degussa (P-25) as a starting material. Copper nanoparticles were anchored on the TNT by homogeneous deposition-precipitation method (HDP) with urea as precipitating agent. The prepared catalysts were tested in a home-made H-cell with 0.5 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution in order to examine their activity for ERC and the optimum copper loading. Continuous gas-phase ERC was carried out in a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) reactor. The 10% Cu/TNT catalysts were employed in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) on the cathode side with Pt-Ru/C on the anode side. Faradaic efficiencies for the three major products namely methanol, methane, and CO were found to be 4%, 3%, and 10%, respectively at -2.5 V with an overall current density of 120 mA/cm(2). The addition of TNT significantly increased the catalytic activity of electrocatalyst for ERC. It is mainly attributed to their better stability towards oxidation, increased CO2 adsorption capacity and stabilization of the reaction intermediate, layered titanates, and larger surface area (400 m(2)/g) as compared with other support materials. Considering the low cost of TNT, it is anticipated that TNT support electrocatalyst for ECR will gain popularity.","[Hossain, S. K.

Hence, material development was determined crucial to balance the overall performance of PEM fuels including the mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of the materials. Studies on conductive polymer composites (cPcs) offered filler with orientation in terms of filler with aspect ratio and shape as an alternative method to enhance the overall performance of the bipolar plate. Filler orientations permit an excellent conductivity network formation while controlling the filler alignment based on required applications. This paper reviewed various studies of filler orientations including materials used and methods of manufacture of CPC materials for the effective development of bipolar plate.

This helped the MFC to reach higher voltage and to generate more power. The higher free nitrous acid (FNA) concentration under the acidic condition helped to increase sludge solubilization. However, under an alkaline condition, during which the FNA concentration was relatively low, the solubilization of the sludge was higher. The highest voltage and power density produced was 390 mV and 153 mW/m(2), respectively, with the addition of nitrite at 100 mg-N/L and pH 9. Furthermore, it was found that elevated levels of FNA could inhibit electrogenic bacteria thus reducing power generation.

Surface and structural properties of the membranes were characterized by Field Emission Scanning electron microscope (FESEM). To understand the interaction between polymer and nanoparticle, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization for the membranes were performed. Highest proton conductivity is 2.30 x 10(-4) S/cm with SPES/STiO2-PANI (0.5%) composite membrane. The presence of modified TiO2 with amine group of PANI and sulfonic acid group were the main factors for the highest conductivity value.

However, purification of syngas to remove multiple impurities such as particulates, tar, HCl, alkali chlorides and sulfur species is required. This study investigates the feasibility of high temperature purification of syngas from MSW gasification with the focus on catalytic tar reforming and desulfurization. Syngas produced from a downdraft fixed-bed gasifier is purified by a multi-stage system. The system comprises of a fluidized-bed catalytic tar reformer, a filter for particulates and a fixed-bed reactor for dechlorination and then desulfurization with overall downward cascading of the operating temperatures throughout the system. Novel nano-structured nickel catalyst supported on alumina and regenerable Ni-Zn desulfurization sorbent loaded on honeycomb are synthesized. Complementary sampling and analysis methods are applied to quantify the impurities and determine their distribution at different stages. Experimental and thermodynamic modeling results are compared to determine the kinetic constraints in the integrated system. The hot purification system demonstrates up to 90% of tar and sulfur removal efficiency, increased total syngas yield (14%) and improved cold gas efficiency (12%). The treated syngas is potentially applicable in gas engines/turbines and solid oxide fuel cells based on the dew points and concentration limits of the remaining tar compounds. Reforming of raw syngas by nickel catalyst for over 20 h on stream shows strong resistance to deactivation. Desulfurization of syngas from MSW gasification containing significantly higher proportion of carbonyl sulfide than hydrogen sulfide, traces of tar and hydrogen chloride demonstrates high performance of Ni-Zn sorbents.","[Chan, Wei Ping; Veksha, Andrei; Lei, Junxi; Oh, Wen-Da; Dou, Xiaomin; Giannis, Apostolos; Lisak, Grzegorz; Lim, Teik-Thye] Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Environm & Water Res Inst, Residues & Resource Reclamat Ctr, 1 Cleantech Loop,Clean Tech One, Singapore 637141, Singapore; [Oh, Wen-Da] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Chem Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Giannis, Apostolos] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, Khania 73100, Greece; [Lisak, Grzegorz; Lim, Teik-Thye] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Chan, WP; Lim, TT (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Environm & Water Res Inst, Residues & Resource Reclamat Ctr, 1 Cleantech Loop,Clean Tech One, Singapore 637141, Singapore.",wpchan@ntu.edu.sg; cttlim@ntu.edu.sg,"Oh, Wen-Da/X-5294-2019; Lim, Teik Thye/A-3790-2011; Chan, Wei Ping/X-2533-2019; Lisak, Grzegorz/ABC-3061-2020; Lisak, Grzegorz/F-3123-2019; Giannis, Apostolos/L-2392-2015","Oh, Wen-Da/0000-0002-1848-7617; Lim, Teik Thye/0000-0002-0386-0394; Chan, Wei Ping/0000-0001-9490-9351; Lisak, Grzegorz/0000-0003-1662-0709; Veksha, Andrei/0000-0003-4647-0342; Giannis, Apostolos/0000-0003-4230-9092","National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, SingaporeSingapore National Research Foundation; National Environment Agency, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore [WTE CRP 1501 105]; Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute; Economic Development Board, SingaporeSingapore Economic Development Board","This research is supported by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore and the National Environment Agency, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore, under the Waste-to-Energy Competitive Research Programme (WTE CRP 1501 105).

A synergistic double-sided ZnO/BaTiO3 loaded carbon plate heterojunction photoanode was fabricated in different ratios by using simple ultrasonication and mixed-annealed method. The double-sided design of photoanode allowed the lights irradiated at both sides of the photoanode. The ferroelectricity fabricated photoanode was applied in a membraneless PFC with platinum-loaded carbon as the cathode. Results revealed that the photoanode with 1:1 ratio of BaTiO3 and ZnO exhibited a superior photocatalytic activity among all the photoanodes prepared in this study. The heterojunction of this photoanode was able to achieve up to a removal efficiency of 93.67% with a maximum power density of 0.5284 AW cm(-2) in 10 mg L-1 of Reactive Red 120 (RR120) without any supporting electrolyte. This photoanode was able to maintain at high performance after recycling 3 times. Overloading of ZnO above 50% on BaTiO3 could lead to deterioration of the performance of PFC due to the charge defects and light trapping ability. The interactions, interesting polarizations of the photocatalysts and proposed mechanism of the n-n type heterojunction in the photoanode of ZnO/BaTiO3 was also discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The three-dimensional PEMFC is comparatively studied as a dual-cell, a quad cell and a hexa-cell stack. The previously investigated modified parallel flow field is used as the anode flow field. The dual-, quad-and hexa-cell stacks are connected in series to study the effect of PEMFC performance when the number of cells increases in a PEMFC stack. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to study the current density generation of a PEMFC stack.

Throughout the works, several efforts were reported to prepare new function of chitosan by chemical modifications for renewable energy, such as fuel cell application. This paper focuses on synthesis of the chitosan derivative, namely, O-nitrochitosan which was synthesized at various compositions of sodium hydroxide and reacted with nitric acid fume. Its potential as biopolymer electrolytes was studied. The substitution of nitro group was analyzed by using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infra-Red (ATR-FTIR) analysis, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Elemental Analysis (CHNS). The structure was characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and its thermal properties were examined by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Whereas, the ionic conductivity of the samples was analyzed by electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). From the IR spectrum results, the nitro group peaks of O-nitrochitosan, positioned at 1646 and 1355 cm(-1), were clearly seen for all pH media. At pH 6, O-nitrochitosan exhibited the highest degree of substitution at 0.74 when analyzed by CHNS analysis and NMR further proved that C-6 of glucosamine ring was shifted to the higher field. However, the thermal stability and glass transition temperatures were decreased with acidic condition. The highest ionic conductivity of O-nitrochitosan was obtained at similar to 10(-6) cm(-1). Overall, the electrochemical property of new O-nitrochitosan showed a good improvement as compared to chitosan and other chitosan derivatives.

X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and UV-visible spectroscopy were used to analyze the chemical stability, morphology, and bandgap, respectively, of the prepared composite powders. All composite electrolytes exhibited cubic fluorite structure as a primary phase and small peaks corresponding to (Li/Na/K)(2)CO3 as an amorphous phase. The bulk densities of the sintered composite electrolyte pellets were in the range of 3.34 g/cm(3)-3.45 g/cm(3) . The total conductivity of the composite electrolyte materials was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in air and hydrogen (90 vol% N-2 + 10 vol% H-2) in the temperature range of 350 degrees C-650 degrees C. The SrDC-ternary carbonate composite electrolyte showed the highest conductivity of 0.092 Scm(-1) and lowest activation energy at 650 degrees C in hydrogen. The formation of hydrated phase from chemical interaction between the carbonates and hydrogen gas and the presence of Sr2+ and cerium ions is useful in enhancing the proton conduction in the SrDC-ternary carbonate system.

Such techniques mainly depend on the adsorbent ability and operating parameters. This research focused on adsorption technology for upgrading biogas technique by developing a novel adsorbent. The commercial coconut shell activated carbon (CAC) and two types of gases (H2S/N-2 and H2S/N-2/CO2) were used. CAC was modified by copper sulfate (CuSO4), zinc acetate (ZnAc2), potassium hydroxide (KOH), potassium iodide (KI), and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) on their surface to increase the selectivity of H2S removal. Commercial H2S adsorbents were soaked in 7 wt.% of impregnated solution for 30 min before drying at 120 degrees C for 24 h. The synthesized adsorbent's physical and chemical properties, including surface morphology, porosity, and structures, were characterized by SEM-EDX, FTIR, XRD, TGA, and BET analyses. For real applications, the modified adsorbents were used in a real-time 0.85 L single-column adsorber unit. The operating parameters for the H2S adsorption in the adsorber unit varied in L/D ratio (0.5-2.5) and feed flow rate (1.5-5.5 L/min) where, also equivalent with a gas hourly space velocity, GHSV (212.4-780.0 hour(-1)) used. The performances of H2S adsorption were then compared with those of the best adsorbent that can be used for further investigation. Characterization results revealed that the impregnated solution homogeneously covered the adsorbent surface, morphology, and properties (i.e., crystallinity and surface area). BET analysis further shows that the modified adsorbents surface area decreased by up to 96%. Hence, ZnAc2-CAC clarify as the best adsorption capacity ranging within 1.3-1.7 mg H2S/g, whereby the studied extended to adsorption-desorption cycle.","[Zulkefli, Nurul Noramelya; Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin; Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan; Jahim, Jamaliah Md] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Res Ctr Sustainable Proc Technol CESPRO, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ukm Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia; [Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin; Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan; Jahim, Jamaliah Md] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Program Chem Engn, Ukm Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia; [Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin; Jahim, Jamaliah Md] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia; [Rejab, Syahril Anuar Md; Lye, Chew Chien] Sime Darby Res Sdn Bhd, Jalan Pulau Carey, Pulau Carey, Selangor, Malaysia","Masdar, MS (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Res Ctr Sustainable Proc Technol CESPRO, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ukm Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.; Masdar, MS (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Program Chem Engn, Ukm Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.; Masdar, MS (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.",shahbud@ukm.edu.my,"Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin/M-2008-2016; Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin/AAA-7572-2019; Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan/C-6454-2015","Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin/0000-0001-5714-7415; Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin/0000-0001-5714-7415; Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan/0000-0002-1051-3120; Chew, Chien Lye/0000-0002-0165-1222","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia [DIP-2017-020, DIP-2017-020 UKM]; Sime Darby Research Sdn Bhd [KK-2014-043]; Sime Darby Research (SDR) Research Project [KK-2014-013]; Sime Darby Research Sdn.

The formation of the single-phase compounds was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld refinement analysis, which showed single peaks corresponding to the (111) plane of the cubic crystal structure. Further analysis was carried out by field emission scanning emission microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical performance was examined by cyclic voltammetry tests. The presence of mesoporous VGCNF as support enables the use of a relatively small amount of metal catalyst that still produces an excellent current density (66.33 mA cm(-2)). Furthermore, the assessment of the kinetic activity of the nanocatalyst using the Tafel plot suggests that Pd1Au1/VGCNF exerts a strong electrocatalytic effect in glycerol oxidation reactions. The engineering challenges are apparent from the fact that the application of the homemade anode catalyst to the passive direct glycerol fuel cell shows the power density of only 3.9 mW cm(-2). To understand the low performance, FESEM observation of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was carried out, examining several morphological defects that play a crucial role and affect the performance of the direct glycerol fuel cell.","[Yahya, N.; Kamarudin, S.

Active electrocatalysts are in high demand to promote the methanol oxidation reaction. The methanol reached at the anode can be immediately reacted, and thus, less methanol to cross to the cathode. The performance of electrocatalysts can be significantly influenced by varying the concentration of precursor solution. Theoretically, concentrated precursor solution facilitates rapid nucleation and growth; diluted precursor solution causes slow nucleation and growth. Rapid nucleation and slow growth have positive effect on the size of electrocatalysts which plays a significant role in the catalytic performance. Upon the addition of appropriate concentration of graphene oxide, the graphene oxide was reported to have stabilizing effect towards the catalyst nanoparticles. This work synthesized reduced graphene oxide-supported palladium electrocatalysts at different concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 mg mL(-1)) with fixed volume and mass ratio of reduced graphene oxide to palladium by microwave-assisted reduction method.

Aluminum alloy (Al5052) is one of the metals used as a bipolar plate because it has a high conductivity, light weight. However, the acidic PEMFC system (pH3-6) is easy for Al5052 ingredients to experience corrosion so as to reduce PEMFC achievement. Therefore, in order to reduce the prevailing sidewalks, this study used a green Arabic gum inhibitor with an electrophoresis deposition (EPD). The impression of a 0.5 gL(-1) Arabic gum-coated Al5052 plate sidewalk in the sulphuric acid solution was tested using an electrochemical method and a morphological test. The surface morphology of Al5052 coated with Arabic gum appeared to be smoother and homogeneous compared to uncoated surface and the cross section of the coating thickness was between 7.5 mu m and 8.8 mu m. Effect of temperature increase (30 degrees C - 90 degrees C) on the interfacial contact resistance (ICR) value of the uncoated Al5052 will decrease from 11.8552 to 9.9042 m Omega cm(2) where the Arabic gum coated has a value of 13,3497 to 11,812 m Omega cm(2). The results showed that Arabic gum can provide protection against metal surfaces where the test using linear tafel polarization technique in 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH4) solution with corrosion current value (I-corr) decreased from 0.00264 to 0.00012 mu A cm(-2). Despite that, the corrosion rate reduced from 3.06 x 10(-5) mpy to 1.61 x 10(-6) mpy as being coted with Arabic gum. It can be concluded that Arabic gum and coating techniques with EPD can be used to reduce corrosion on the Al5052 plate, therefore, the life span of this material is longer and may reach the targets set by the DOE for bipolar plates.","[Arwati, I.

Furthermore, the addition of phase change materials into photovoltaic thermal systems adds more dual benefits in terms of cooling of PV cell as well as heat storage. Hence, there are still issues to transfer heat from the system efficiently, which cause lower performance of PVT and PVT-PCM systems. In this paper, the aluminium material of thermal collector is used by introducing a novel design to enhance heat transfer performance, which is assembled in PVT and PVT-PCM systems. Experimental validation is carried out for the 3D FEM-based numerical analysis with COMSOL Multiphysics (R) at 200 W/m(2) to 1000 W/m(2) varying irradiation levels while keeping mass flow rate fixed at 0.5LPM and inlet water temperature at 32 degrees C. The experiment is carried out at outdoor free weather conditions with passive cooling of the module by an overhead water tank scheme. A good agreement in numerical and experimental results is achieved through experimental validation. Cell temperature reduction of 12.6 degrees C and 10.3 degrees C is achieved from the PV module in case of the PVT-PCM system. The highest value of the electrical efficiency achieved is 13.72 13.56% for PV and 13.85 and 13.74% for PVT numerically and experimentally respectively. Similarly, for PVT-PCM, electrical efficiency is achieved as 13.98 and 13.87% numerically and experimentally respectively. In the case of the PVT system, electrical performance is improved as 6.2 and 4.8% and for PVT-PCM, it is improved as 7.2 and 7.6% for numerically and experimentally respectively.","[Fayaz, H.; Rahim, N.

A new class of highly conductive and durable composite membranes is prepared for high temperature fuel cell application under anhydrous conditions. 2,6-Pyridine functionalized polybenzimidazole (Py-PBI) is used as substrate for hosting phosphoric acid moiety. A highly dispersible phosphonated graphene oxide (PGO) introduced to Py-PBI substrate at different levels prior to acid doping and conductivity, durability and fuel cell performance of developed membranes are evaluated. A proton conductivity as high as 76.4 x 10(-3)S cm(-1) is achieved at 140 degrees C under anhydrous condition. A strong correlation is found between the content of PGO and the stability of the acid content despite similarity in doping level. In general, the conductivity is obviously more stable in the PGO containing membranes. A Pt-catalyzed fuel cell using the developed composite membranes show a peak power density > 359 mW cm(-2) at 120 degrees C under anhydrous condition which is above 75% improvements compared to the membranes without the phosphonated filler. This work demonstrates that the adopted membrane preparation strategy and their observed properties pave the way for highly conductive and durable proton conducting membranes.","[Abouzari-Lotf, Ebrahim; Zakeri, Masoumeh; Mozarmnia, Pooria; Bazilah, Nur Anati; Emelin, Noor Fatina; Ahmad, Arshad] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Inst Future Energy, Ctr Hydrogen Energy, Adv Mat Res Grp, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia; [Abouzari-Lotf, Ebrahim; Ahmad, Arshad] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Chem Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Zakeri, Masoumeh; Miyake, Mikio; Bazilah, Nur Anati; Emelin, Noor Fatina] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Malaysia Japan Int Inst Technol, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia; [Nasef, Mohamed Mahmoud] Univ Teknol Petronas, Dept Chem Engn, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia","Abouzari-Lotf, E (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Inst Future Energy, Ctr Hydrogen Energy, Adv Mat Res Grp, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia.",Ebrahim@utm.my,,"Abouzari-Lotf, Ebrahim/0000-0002-0549-4199",Fundamental Research Grant (FRGS) - Ministry of Higher Education [4F878]; Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology [00580],The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support from Fundamental Research Grant (FRGS) awarded by Ministry of Higher Education (Vot.# 4F878) and support from Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology (Vot.# 00580).,,41,20,21,7,71,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-7753,1873-2755,,J POWER SOURCES,J.

TRIMON includes important features that improve certain functionalities that are less optimal in most state-of-the-art Monte Carlo codes such as direct integration of local fuel burnup in core calculation, sophisticated reactor core design considerations and simulation time improvements in complex core configurations.

Citrus wastewater was used as a feed source for biohydrogen production. Different treatment intensities (TI) of EP for 0.5 min (TI = 30 kWh/m(3)), 1 min (TI = 60 kWh/m(3)), and 2 min (TI = 120 kWh/m(3)) were employed to observe the effects of EP on the microbial community of AS. Furthermore, sonication with a probe, sonication in a bath, and heat-shock pretreatments were also conducted to compare the hydrogen yield with EP. The cell inactivation was evaluated and visualized using colony forming units (CFU) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), respectively. Among the different TIs, the TI of 60 kWh/m(3) achieved higher methanogen inactivation with maximum hydrogen (896 mL) production compared to other EP pretreatments after 180 h of dark fermentation. In comparison with other pretreatments, the highest hydrogen production of 896 mL was achieved with EP treatment, followed by sonication with a probe (678 mL) and sonication in a bath (563 mL). The heat-shock pretreatment exhibited the lowest ultimate hydrogen production of 545 mL among the four different methods applied in this study. The outcome of this study suggests that EP is a promising technique for pretreating mixed cultures for the enhanced production of biohydrogen.","[Karim, Ahasanul; Faizal, Che Ku Mohammad] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Engn Technol, Gambang 26300, Malaysia; [Islam, M.

In addition, the cost of the membrane is very high and remains the main issue for the commercialization of Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC). To solve this problem, this study introduces rice husk ash (RHA) as a bio-filler in sulfonated polyimide (SPI) composite membranes. The bio-filler is expected to reduce the cost of the membrane and at the same time increase the performance of the membrane. In this work, agricultural rice husk waste was subjected to oxidation to produce RHA. The composite membrane displayed maximum values for the ion exchange capacity (0.2829 mmol g(-1)) and water uptake (55.24%). It was observed that the proton conductivity (0.2058 S cm(-1)) was higher than that in the pristine SPI membrane. The methanol permeability of the SPI-RHA membranes was reduced to 24 times lower than that of the pristine SPI membrane. In the DMFC passive single-cell test, the maximum power density was increased from 8.0 mW cm(-1) to 13.0 mW cm(-1) using a composite membrane with 15 wt % RHA. These composite membranes have proven that the addition of RHA enhanced the performances of the fuel cell and have a very high potential to act as an alternative bio-filler for the membranes used in a direct methanol fuel cell.

The open and closed SMFCs were showed the maximum voltage generation 300.5 mV (77.75 mW/m(2)) and 202.7 mV (45.04 (mW/m(2)), respectively. The cyclic voltammetry showed the oxidation peak in open SMFCs at +1.9 m A and reduction peak at -0.3 mu A but in closed SMFCs oxidation and reduction peaks were noted at +1.5 mu A and -1.0 mu A, respectively. The overall impedance (anode, cathode and solution) of closed SMFCs was higher than open SMFCs. The charge transfer impedance showed that the rates of substrate oxidation and reduction were very low in the closed SMFCs than open SMFCs. The Nyquist arc indicated that O-2 act as electron acceptor in the open SMFCs and CO2 in the closed SMFCs. The highest remediation efficiency of toxic metals [Hg (II) ions, Zn (II) ions, and Ag (I) ions] in the open SMFCs were 95.03%, 86.69%, and 83.65% in closed SMFCs were 69.53%, 66.57%, and 65.33%, respectively, observed during 60-80 days.

Milling time is an important parameter in producing pure composite powders with fine crystallite size and affects the densification of the sintered pellet and the electrical performance of the cell. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were conducted to characterise nickel-oxide-samarium-doped cerium (NiO-SDC) powders milled for different durations (2, 12, and 24 h). Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis was performed to clarify the porosity of the sintered pellets. Density was determined using Archimedes method and was found to decrease after the reduction of the anode pellets. The XRD analysis of the composite anodes showed good chemical compatibility between the NiO and SDC. The TEM analysis of the as-prepared powders indicated that the particle size of the powder was within the nanometre range. This finding was confirmed by the FESEM micrograph of the sintered pellets. The porosity of the sintered pellets (before and after reduction) ranged from 20% to 40% and was considered sufficient for anode materials in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).","[Raduwan, Nor Fatina; Ali, S.

Thus, scaling up or upgrading SSMFCs for enhanced and efficient performance is a highly crucial task. Therefore, in order to achieve this goal, an innovative physical technique of using interface layers with four different pore sizes embedded in the middle of SSMFCs was utilized in this study. Experimental results showed that the performance of SSMFCs employing an interface layer was improved regardless of the pore size of the interface material, compared to those without such layers. The use of an interface layer resulted in a positive and significant effect on the performance of SSMFCs because of the effective prevention of oxygen diffusion from the cathode to the anode. Nevertheless, when a smaller pore size interface was utilized, better power performance and COD degradation were observed. A maximum power density of 0.032 mW/m(2) and COD degradation of 47.3% were obtained in the case of an interface pore size of 0.28 mu m. The findings in this study are of significance to promote the future practical application of SSMFCs in wastewater treatment plants.

In this study, a single chamber air-cathode in a membrane-less MFC (ML-MFC) was operated in batch mode with dewatered sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant as the substrate. Electrogenic bacterial species in the sludge acted as a catalyst for the generation of electricity. The performance of the ML-MFC was evaluated using one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method followed by response surface methodology (RSM) via Central Composite Design using a quadratic model. In the preliminary OFAT study, the highest voltage generation (852.7 mV) and COD removal (149.2 mg/L) were obtained when the pH, electrode distance, moisture content, and temperature were at 6.0, 3 cm, 30% (vol/wt), and 35 degrees C, respectively. After incubation of the ML-MFC using optimum conditions suggested by the RSM, the voltage was successfully increased to 927.7 mV (improved 9%), while COD removal increased to 170.8 mg/L (improved 15%). This showed that optimization using RSM gave better results than the OFAT method. The maximum power density recorded from the optimum conditions was 41.3 mW/m(2).

In this study, three different types of photocatalysts: TiO2, ZnO and alpha-Fe2O3 were immobilized respectively on carbon cloth (CC), and applied as photoanodes in the photocatalytic fuel cell of this hybrid system. Photocatalytic fuel cell was employed to drive a peroxi-coagulation process by generating the external voltage accompanying with degrading organic pollutants under UV light irradiation. The degradation efficiency of Amaranth dye and power output in the hybrid system of PFC-PC were evaluated by applying different photoanode materials fabricated in this study. In addition, the effect of light on the photocurrent of three different photoanode materials was investigated. In the absence of light, the reduction of photocurrent percentage was found to be 69.7%, 17.3% and 93.2% in TiO2/CC, ZnO/CC and alpha-Fe2O3/CC photoanodes, respectively. A maximum power density (1.17 mWcm(-2)) and degradation of dye (93.8%) at PFC reactor were achieved by using ZnO/CC as photoanode. However, the different photoanode materials at PFC showed insignificant difference in dye degradation trend in the PC reactor. Meanwhile, the degradation trend of Amaranth at PFC reactor was influenced by the recombination rate, electron mobility and band gap energy of photocatalyst among different photoanode materials.

The selectivity of sodium alginate-based membrane as a function of sulfonated graphene oxide and glycerol content is analysed using response surface methodology. It is observed that the properties of the membrane are strongly influenced by the glycerol and sulfonated graphene oxide loading in order to produce the optimum morphology and conducting properties, thus affecting the selectivity of the membrane and consequently the overall performance of the direct methanol fuel cell. The objective of this study is to determine the parameters that significantly affecting the performance of the membrane. Two parameters were taken into consideration that is the weight percentage of sulfonated graphene oxide and glycerol loadings. Both are determined approximately 0.5 wt% to 5 wt% and 0.5 ml-6.0 ml, respectively. The best selectivity result is achieved by using SA/SGO biomembrane with loadings of 2.78 wt% SGO and 3.11 ml of glycerol, respectively. The selectivity is determined as 12.956 x 10(4) S scm(-3). This study proves that the sulfonated graphene oxide and glycerol improved the final membrane structures and performances of the membrane based on numerical analysis, the observation from field emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscope structural analysis as well as the performance of direct methanol fuel cell.

In this study, the photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) employing ZnO/Zn photoanode and CuO/Cu photocathode was successfully designed for effective greywater recycling as well as energy recovery. The photoelectrodes were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The PFC performance in terms of electricity generation and parallel methyl green (MG) degradation were evaluated under operating parameters such as electrolyte type, initial MG concentration and solution pH. The results showed that the addition of Na2SO4 electrolyte, MG concentration of 40 mg L-1 and solution pH of 5.2 improved the short circuit current density (J(sc)) and power density (P-max) in the as-constructed PFC. Such a system also afforded highest MG and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies after 4 h of irradiation. The photoanodes used in this study demonstrated great recyclability after four repetition tests. The COD removal was reduced to some extents when the PFC treatment was tested in the real greywater under optimal conditions. Various greywater quality parameters including ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), turbidity, pH and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) were also monitored. The phytotoxicity experiments via Vigna radiate seeds indicated a reduction in the phytotoxicity.","[Kee, Ming-Wei; Soo, Jian-Wen; Lam, Sze-Mun] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Dept Environm Engn, Fac Engn & Green Technol, Jalan Univ, Kampar 31900, Perak, Malaysia; [Sin, Jin-Chung] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Dept Petrochem Engn, Fac Engn & Green Technol, Jalan Univ, Kampar 31900, Perak, Malaysia; [Mohamed, Abdul Rahman] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Chem Engn, Engn Campus, Nibong Tebal 14300, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia","Lam, SM (corresponding author), Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Dept Environm Engn, Fac Engn & Green Technol, Jalan Univ, Kampar 31900, Perak, Malaysia.",lamsm@utar.edu.my,"Mohamed, Abdul Rahman/A-9667-2010; Mun, Lam Sze/H-6449-2016; CHUNG, SIN JIN/H-6001-2016","Mohamed, Abdul Rahman/0000-0002-5418-5456; Mun, Lam Sze/0000-0001-5118-8144; CHUNG, SIN JIN/0000-0002-1177-5894","Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman [UTARRF/2018-C1/L02, UTARRF/2018-C1/S02]; Ministry of Higher Education, MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [FRGS/1/2015/TK02/UTAR/02/2, FRGS/1/2016/TK02/UTAR/02/1]","This research was supported by Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTARRF/2018-C1/L02 and UTARRF/2018-C1/S02) and Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia (FRGS/1/2015/TK02/UTAR/02/2 and FRGS/1/2016/TK02/UTAR/02/1).",,75,18,18,3,58,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate structural and dynamics characteristic of C4U in the membrane comparing with the SPEEK-hydronium membrane model as a control. From simulations, thermal effect on water and proton carriers cluster surrounding the sulfonate groups was explored. At higher temperature, the more transport dynamics of C4U ions in SPEEK membranes were found than that of hydronium ions in the control system. Likewise, phase separation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts was taken into consideration here. A critical role of the enhancing proton conductivity by increasing the diffusion coefficient at temperature beyond C4U melting point in composite polymer membrane was emphasized.

Despite not being fully explored and not yet widely applicable for cell-based sensors, the high stability of aryl diazonium salt formed sensing system is highly favorable in biological applications. Carbon-based electrodes are the most commonly used in aryl diazonium modification due to its post grafting stable C-C bond formation. Here, salt bridge based microbial fuel cells ( mFcs) were used to study on the effect of aryl diazonium modification on the anode graphite fibre brush. Aryl diazonium salts were in situ generated by the diazonation of p-phenylenediamine with NaNO2 in HCl solution. The electrochemical performance of the aryl diazonium modified graphite brush MFC was measured and compared with the unmodified graphite brush MFC. The power output of the modified graphite brush bioanode was higher (833 W/m(3)) than the unmodified graphite brush (7.60 W/m(3)) after 20 days of operation with ferricyanide as the catholyte. After 70 days of operation using phosphate buffer solution as the catholyte, the P-max of modified brush was three times higher (0.06 W/m(3)) than of the unmodified brush (0.02 W/m(3)), which indicates an enhanced binding towards the substrate that facilitates a better electron transfer between the microbial and electrode surface.","[Rusli, Siti Farah Nadiah; Abu Bakar, Mimi Hani; Shyuan, Loh Kee; Mastar, Mohd Shahbudin] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Rani, Seratul Jemiah Abdul] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Mastar, Mohd Shahbudin] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Build Environm, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia","Abu Bakar, MH (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",mimihani@ukm.edu.my,,,"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) [FRGS/1/2014/TK06/UKM/03/1, GUP-2015-036]; Faculty of Science and Technology of UKM",The authors gratefully acknowledge the support given for this work by FRGS/1/2014/TK06/UKM/03/1 and GUP-2015-036 from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM).

Pt, as the main obstacle for commercialisation in the range of 0.1-0.5 mg/cm(2), degree of sulphonation in SPEEK, as a new proton exchange membrane in the range of 20-80%, and rate of aeration of cathode between 10 and 150 ml/min were optimised to identify a more commercial MFC. The single maximum response of power density and COD removal and simultaneous maximisation of both responses were obtained at the corresponding optimal independent variables. The results show that the optimised condition for power density and COD removal is at DS 68% and aeration of 121.62 ml/min. However, the pt load differs and is 0.42 mg/cm(2) for produced power density and 0.28 mg/cm(2) for COD removal. The maximum produced power density in the optimised situation was 58.19 mW/m(2) while the maximum COD removal in the optimised condition was 94.8%.

The optimum degradation of batik wastewater was at pH 9 with external resistor 250 Omega. It was observed that open circuit of PFC showed only 17.2 +/- 7.5% of removal efficiency, meanwhile the degradation rate of batik wastewater was enhanced to 31.9 +/- 15.0% for closed circuit with external resistor 250 Omega. The decolorization of batik wastewater in the absence of photocatalyst due to the absorption of light irradiation by dye molecules and this process was known as photolysis. The degradation of batik wastewater increased as the external resistor value decreased. In addition, the degradation rate of batik wastewater also increased at pH 9 which was 74.4 +/- 34.9% and at pH 3, its degradation rate was reduced to 19.4 +/- 8.7%. The presence of aeration and sodium chloride as supporting electrolyte in batik wastewater also affected its degradation and electricity generation. The maximum absorbance of wavelength (lambda(max)) of batik wastewater at 535 nm and chemical oxygen demand gradually decreased as increased in irradiation time; however, batik wastewater required prolonged irradiation time to fully degrade and mineralize in PFC system.","[Khalik, Wan Fadhilah; Ong, Soon-An; Wong, Yee-Shian; Yusuf, Sara Yasina; Yusoff, Nik Athirah] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Environm Engn, Water Res Grp WAREG, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia; [Ho, Li-Ngee; Voon, Chun-Hong; Lee, Sin-Li] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Mat Engn, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia","Ho, LN (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Mat Engn, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia.",holingee@yahoo.com,"YUSUF, SARA YASINA/B-9242-2012; Yusoff, NikAthirah/AAL-1457-2020; Khalik, Wan Fadhilah Wan Mohd/AAK-3725-2020","YUSUF, SARA YASINA/0000-0002-4630-6094; Yusoff, NikAthirah/0000-0002-4830-1852; YEE-SHIAN, WONG/0000-0002-6238-5247","Fundamental Research Grant Scheme by the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia [FRGS/1/2016/STG01/UNIMAP/02/1]","This project is supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2016/STG01/UNIMAP/02/1) provided by the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia.",,63,4,4,3,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

This work features a systematic study of the electrochemical performance of SrCo(0.8)Nb(0.1)Tac(0.1)O(3-delta) (SCNT)-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (GDC) composite cathode under CO2 exposure for SOFC operation in low-temperature (LT, 500 degrees C and below) and intermediate-temperature (IT, 500-700 degrees C) ranges. The complementary results from powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, in situ high temperature XRD, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and the single cell test show that SCNT-GDC cathode exhibit slightly lower electrochemical performance but higher CO2 resistance than SCNT, which enables practical SOFC application. At 550 degrees C, SCNT-GDC-based single cell has a peak power density of 630 mW cm(-2) and reduces to a stable power density of 525 mW cm(-2) after exposure to air containing 1 vol% CO2 for 2 h.

The purpose of this study was to develop a catalytic process for selective decomposition of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the pyrolysis gas as these species compromise the operation of gas engines, gas turbines and fuel cells. The effect of different calcium supports, namely CaCO3, Ca(OH)(2), CaO and their mixtures, on the performance of Ni-based catalytic sorbents during the decomposition of hydrocarbons and HCl sorption from non-condensable pyrolysis gas of mixed plastics was investigated. The plastic mixture containing low density polyethylene (40%), polypropylene (40%), polystyrene (10%) and polyvinyl chloride (10%) was initially pyrolyzed at 600 degrees C producing condensable oils and non-condensable gases. The non-condensable gases were further treated in a subsequent reactor at 700 degrees C in the presence of catalytic sorbents. All catalytic sorbents were effective for HCl sorption, decreasing the HCl concentration in the gas stream below detectable levels. However, the choice of calcium support had a substantial effect on the catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons and the properties of produced carbon deposits. CaCO3, Ca(OH)(2) and their mixture at 1:1 ratio by mass loaded with Ni showed higher catalytic activity towards the decomposition of hydrocarbons compared to CaO and a mixture containing CaO, CaCO3 and Ca(OH)(2) at 1:1:1 ratio by mass. Furthermore, carbon deposits produced on the surface of Ni supported on CaCO3, Ca(OH)(2) and their mixture contained multi-walled carbon nanotubes, whereas carbon deposits produced on Ni supported on CaO and the mixture containing CaO had non-filamentous morphology. The observed results can be attributed to the low BET specific surface areas and pore volumes of CaO-containing catalytic sorbents which could limit the dispersion of Ni resulting in low catalytic activity.

This study focused on integrating different applicable functions in one setup to promote applying MDCs in actual scale. In this research, the behavior of the MDC upon applying different salt concentrations in the desalination chamber was studied. Moreover, salt, sulphate and organic matter removal in acetate and sulphate-fed MDCs (A.MDC and S.MDC) were investigated. 10, 20 and 35 g/l of salt were successfully removed by using MDC technology. Sulphate removal of 72% was achieved within the S.MDC setup while similar current productions were observed in both A.MDC and S.MDC. Higher COD removal (88%) was recorded in S.MDC compared to 65% in A.MDC. Furthermore, the microbial communities were characterized and Rubrivivax was identified as the dominant genus in A.MDC while Desulfobulbus, Geobacter and Desulfovibrio were the most abundant genera in S.MDC setup.","[Jafary, Tahereh; Daud, Wan Ramli Wan] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Aljlil, Saad A.] King Abdulaziz City Sci & Technol, Natl Ctr Water Treatment & Desalinat Technol, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi] UTM, FCEE, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Al-Mamun, Abdullah; Baawain, Mahad S.] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, POB 33,Al Khoud 123, Muscat, Oman; [Ghasemi, Mostafa] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Petr Engn Dept, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia","Ghasemi, M (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Petr Engn Dept, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.",mostafa.baboli@utp.edu.my,"Daud, Wan Ramli/B-3635-2013; Jafary, Tahereh/AAD-3280-2021; Al-Mamun, Abdullah/ABH-8121-2020; Baawain, Mahad/S-8010-2019","Daud, Wan Ramli/0000-0002-1023-456X; Al-Mamun, Abdullah/0000-0002-5642-2945; Ghasemi, Mostafa/0000-0002-1497-1591",King Abdul Aziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) of Saudi Arabia [12015 KACST-ITM-CNR]; Petroleum Engineering Department and Technology Transfer Office of the Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) of Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia [MI -2018013]; Institute of Contaminant Management (ICM) of UTP [0153AA-F81],"The authors gratefully acknowledge the invaluable financial supports and the kind collaboration of King Abdul Aziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) of Saudi Arabia through the agreement No: 12015 KACST-ITM-CNR.; The authors extend their appreciation to the Petroleum Engineering Department and Technology Transfer Office of the Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) of Malaysia as well as Institute of Contaminant Management (ICM) of UTP for their kind supports under STIRF grant No: 0153AA-F81.; Moreover, W.R.W.

The process parameters and fabrication techniques of PP-based composite materials were studied. Various structures of carbon allotrope-based materials, including synthetic graphite (SG), exfoliated graphene nanoplatelets (xGnP), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and carbon black (CB), were used to fabricate the PP-based nanocomposites. The nanocomposites were prepared by either direct melt mixing using an internal mixer or by ball milling of components before the melt mixing process. The electrical and flexural properties were measured. In order to understand the conductivity behavior, both in-plane and through-plane electrical conductivities were measured. The results showed that the incorporation of the xGnP into PP/60 wt.% SG composites resulted in a slight increase of the in-plane conductivities and had a minimal effect on the through-plane conductivities. The addition of MWCNTs and CB to the PP/SG/xGnP composites had a significant effect on the electrical properties and was more pronounced in the case of MWCNTs. The flexural properties of all samples were much lower than those of pure PP. The interface between the filler and the PP matrix and the morphology of the composite materials were observed from the fracture surfaces of the composites using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, SEM was employed to observe adhesion, microstructural homogeneity, orientation of the xGnP platelets and agglomeration in the composites.","[Dweiri, Radwan] Al Balqa Appl Univ, Dept Mat Engn, Al Salt 19117, Jordan; [Dweiri, Radwan; Suherman, Hendra; Sulong, Abu Bakar] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia; [Suherman, Hendra] Univ Bung Hatta, Dept Mech Engn, Padang 25143, West Sumatera, Indonesia; [Sulong, Abu Bakar] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Al-Sharab, Jafar F.] Northwestern State Univ Louisiana, Dept Engn Technol, Natchitoches, LA 71497 USA","Dweiri, R (corresponding author), Al Balqa Appl Univ, Dept Mat Engn, Al Salt 19117, Jordan.; Dweiri, R (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.",rdweiri@yahoo.com,"Suherman, Hendra/AAB-9612-2021; Dweiri, Radwan/D-5299-2018","Suherman, Hendra/0000-0003-0685-3656; Dweiri, Radwan/0000-0002-9613-6222; Sulong, Abu Bakar/0000-0003-4637-1758",Al-Balqa Applied University; Fuel Cell Institute/Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,The authors would like to acknowledge the Al-Balqa Applied University as well as the Fuel Cell Institute/Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia for their highly appreciated help and support.,,21,2,2,4,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0792-1233,2191-0359,,SCI ENG COMPOS MATER,Sci.

Formic acid is one of the prominent sources of clean and cheap hydrogen. In this work, Fe-Zn-Ir nanocatalysts show exceptional performance for selective hydrogen production via HCOOH decomposition, offering a promising alternative that could solve issues associated with hydrogen storage and distribution. Our results show that Fe atoms on the Fe-Zn-Ir surface are responsible for activating the HCOOH molecules; however, the identity of the surface metal atoms (Ir and Zn) dictate the selectivity of the reaction adjacent to the Fe atoms when there is no CO contamination. The high content of Fe atoms that reside at the Fe-Zn-Ir interface sites favored the dehydrogenation of HCOOH. The greater selectivity towards H-2 was measured to be 97.4% at 30min for the higher Fe content (50wt%). These observations suggest that by controlling the arrangement of surface Fe, Zn, and Ir atoms, the reactivity and selectivity of HCOOH decomposition over Fe-Zn-Ir catalysts could be tailored, optimizing the surface composition. The findings in this study may prove informative for the rational design of Fe-Zn-Ir catalyst systems for reactions associated with hydrogen production, such as for fuel cell applications.","[Azizi, Masitah Abdul Halim; Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan; Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Res Ctr Sustainable Proc Technol, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan; Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Chem Engn Programme, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Somalu, Mahendra Rao] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Yarmo, Mohd Ambar] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Sch Chem Sci & Food Technol, Fac Sci & Techn, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia","Isahak, WNRW (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Res Ctr Sustainable Proc Technol, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.; Isahak, WNRW (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Chem Engn Programme, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",wannorroslam@ukm.edu.my,"Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin/AAA-7572-2019; Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin/M-2008-2016; Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan/C-6454-2015","Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin/0000-0001-5714-7415; Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin/0000-0001-5714-7415; Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan/0000-0002-1051-3120; Somalu, Mahendra Rao/0000-0003-1667-693X","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) [DIP-2016-010, GUP-2016-057]; Ministry of Higher EducationScience and Technology Development Fund (STDF)Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR) [FRGS/1/2015/SG01/UKM/02/2]","The authors wish to thank the organizations that funded this research: The Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) under research Grants DIP-2016-010 and GUP-2016-057, and the Ministry of Higher Education under research Grant FRGS/1/2015/SG01/UKM/02/2.

The strong interconnection among the nanofibers and the intimate contact between rGO and TiO2 in TiO2/rGO composite improved the efficient electron transportation paths, facilitating the higher oxidation and continuous and stable currents as substantiated, respectively, from the cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry studies. By coupling the continuous electron conduction paths, proficient cell interaction, and elevated structural and chemical stabilities, TiO2/rGO demonstrated the BPV power density of 34.66 +/- 1.3 mWm(-2) with excellent durability, outperforming the BPV performances of previous reports.

However, operational and technological developments are still required to make it as a sustainable technology. In the present study, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to evaluate the effects of substrate concentration, co-culture composition, pH and time on the performance of co-culture (Klebsiella variicola and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) inoculated double chamber MFC. From the statistical analysis, it can be seen that the performance of MFC was not influenced by the interaction between the initial COD and time, pH and time, pH and initial COD, time and initial COD. However, the interaction between the inoculum composition and time, pH and the inoculum composition, initial COD and inoculum composition significantly influenced the performance of MFC. Based on the RSM results, best performance (power density and COD removal efficiency) was obtained when the inoculum composition, initial COD, pH and time were about 1:1, 26.690 mg/L, 7.21 and 15.50 days, respectively. The predictions from the model were in close agreement with the experimental results suggesting that the proposed model could adequately represent the actual relationships between the independent variables generating electricity and the COD removal efficiency.","[Islam, M.

Plain Carbon cloth (CC) and surface modified CC with four different sizes of Biochar (BC) particles such as 2 mm BC< 2, BC2-4, BC4-6, and BC6-10 were employed as anode electrodes in dual-chambered MFCs and their performance was compared. Results showed that the electrode with BC< 2 enhanced the MFC performance to with power density of 312 mWm(-2) and BC6-10 facilitated the maximum COD degradation performance of 77% in the MFC both due to electrode properties like high porosity and large surface area.

As most transport systems use fossil fuel and emit greenhouse gases, many researchers have studied the potential of fuel-cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEVs). FCHEVs are vehicles with zero greenhouse gas emission because they only depend on hydrogen. Numerous studies have proven that fuel cells with energy storage elements can provide sufficient energy required by FCHEVs. However, end users demand FCHEVs that are not only efficient in delivering the energy required but can also optimize hydrogen consumption and prolong battery lifetime to compete with current internal combustion engine vehicles. Therefore, advanced optimization algorithms for an FCHEV energy management system (EMS) must be developed to improve the performance efficiency of FCHEVs. This paper presents a critical review of the different types of FCHEV EMSs and their optimization algorithms to solve existing limitations and enhance the performance of future FCHEVs. Consequently, a comprehensive review on the major categories of FCHEV EMSs, such as proportional-integral-derivative controller, operational or state mode, rule-based or fuzzy logic, and equivalent consumption minimization strategies, are explained. This paper also describes optimization techniques such as linear programming, dynamic programming, Pontryagin's minimum principle, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and rule-based logic optimization for the EMSs of FCHEVs. Furthermore, it focuses on the various factors and challenges of existing optimization algorithms, hydrogen fuel source, environment and safety, and economical and societal concerns, as well as provides recommendations for designing capable and efficient EMSs for FCHEVs. All the highlighted insights of this review will hopefully lead to increasing efforts toward the development of an advanced optimization algorithm for future FCHEV EMSs.","[Sulaiman, N.; Majlan, E.

The best membrane had high proton conductivity (10.1 x 10(-3)Scm(-1)) and very low methanol permeability (1.984 x 10(-7)cm(2)s(-1)), which consequently resulted in very high selectivity (5.0907 x 10(4) Sscm(-3)).

The decolourisation efficiencies were up to 91% for 500 mg/L of Acid Red 18 (AR18). However, the power density declined with the increment in azo dye concentration. The results suggest that the combination of salinity and aeration at an optimum level improved the power performance. The highest power density achieved was 8.67 mW/m(2). The increase of nitrate by 3-fold led to decrease in decolourisation and power density of the system. The findings revealed that the electron acceptors (AR18, nitrate and anode) competed at the anodic region for electrons and the electron transfer pathways would directly influence the treatment and power performance of UFCW-MFC.

A photocatalytic fuel cell is constructed based on the idea of immobilizing zinc oxide onto zinc photoanode and platinum loaded carbon cathode, both evaluated under sunlight and ultraviolet irradiation, respectively. Influence of light and dye structures on the performance of photocatalytic fuel cell are examined. With reactive green 19, 93% and 86% of color removal are achieved after 8 h of photocatalytic fuel cell treatment under sunlight and ultraviolet irradiation, respectively. The decolorization rate of diazo reactive green 19 is higher than acid orange 7 (monoazo dye) when both dyes are treated by photocatalytic fuel cell under sunlight and ultraviolet irradiation, as the electron releasing groups (-NH-triazine) allow reactive green 19 easier to be oxidized. Comparatively, acid orange 7 is less favorable to be oxidized. The degradation of methylene blue is enhanced under sunlight irradiation due to the occurrence of self-sensitized photodegradation.

Though colour treatment using adsorption processes at lower pH (<4) have been reported effectual, due to its acidity the remediated effluent poses an environmental hazard as a result. Thus, the current study focused on achieving decolourization at neutral pH by enhancing the morphology of the coconut shell activated carbon (CSAC) using N-2 as activating-agent with microwave irradiation heating. The microwave pretreated and non-pretreated CSAC were characterized using scanned electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. A significant modification in the porous structure with a 66.62% increase in the specific surface area was achieved after the pretreatment. The adsorption experimental matrix was developed using the central composite design to investigate the colour adsorption performance under varied pH (6-7), dosage (2-6 g) and contact time (10-100 min). At optimum conditions of neutral pH (7), 3.208 g dosage and contact time of 35 min, the percentage of colour removal was 96.29% with negligible differences compared with the predicted value, 95.855%. The adsorption equilibrium capacity of 1430.1 ADMI x mL/g was attained at the initial colour concentration of 2025 ADMI at 27 degrees C. The experimental data fitted better with the Freundlich isotherm model with R-2 0.9851.","[Abdulsalam, Mohammed; Man, Hasfalina Che] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Fac Engn, Upm Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Abdulsalam, Mohammed] Ahmadu Bello Univ, Dept Agr & Bioresources Engn, Zaria 810222, Nigeria; [Idris, Aida Isma] Segi Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Kota Damansara 47810, Selangor, Malaysia; [Abidin, Zurina Zainal] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Chem Engn, Fac Engn, Upm Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Abidin, Zurina Zainal] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Environm Engn, Fac Engn, Upm Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Yunos, Khairul Faezah] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Food & Proc Engn, Fac Engn, Upm Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia","Abdulsalam, M (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Fac Engn, Upm Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.; Abdulsalam, M (corresponding author), Ahmadu Bello Univ, Dept Agr & Bioresources Engn, Zaria 810222, Nigeria.",m.abdul_22@yahoo.com; hasfalina@upm.edu.my; aidaisma@segi.edu.my; zurina@upm.edu.my; kfaezah@upm.edu.my,"Abidin, Zurina Zainal/AAL-2706-2020","Abidin, Zurina Zainal/0000-0002-3998-2545; Abdulsalam, Mohammed/0000-0001-9297-6286; md yunos, khairul faezah/0000-0001-6465-700X",Universiti Putra Malaysia [9530900]; Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND),This study was sponsored by the Universiti Putra Malaysia with grant number PUTRA Impak: 9530900 and Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND).,,67,5,5,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1660-4601,,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Flow configurations with alternated air flows in parallel and perpendicular to the fuel flows are considered in addition to the conventional co-, counter-, and cross-flow configurations. The stacks have eight cells with unity aspect ratio and an active area of 4900 mm(2) and are compared at fuel utilization of 0.193, 0.386, 0.579, and 0.772. The numerical model is capable of analyzing both the streamwise and spanwise directions of the cells. Although the counter-flow stack achieves the highest voltage efficiency among the stacks with the conventional flow configurations, it has the highest dispersion of the current density distribution on the cells. Air-flow alternation is effective to achieve uniform and high cell temperature and hence low dispersion of the current density. Alternate air flows parallel to the fuel flows achieve the highest voltage efficiency of 0.797 at a fuel utilization of 0.772, while alternate air flows perpendicular to the fuel flows reduce the risk of local fuel depletion as compared with the cross-flow stacks. Appropriate selection of the air-flow configuration within stacks allows operation at higher efficiency without fuel depletion.","[Tan, Wee Choon; Iwai, Hiroshi; Kishimoto, Masashi; Yoshida, Hideo] Kyoto Univ, Dept Aeronaut & Astronaut, Nishikyo Ku, Kyoto 6158540, Japan; [Tan, Wee Choon] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Mechatron Engn, Perlis 02600, Malaysia","Tan, WC (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Aeronaut & Astronaut, Nishikyo Ku, Kyoto 6158540, Japan.",tweechoon@unimap.edu.my,"Tan, Wee Choon/D-2550-2015","Tan, Wee Choon/0000-0002-0615-9800","New Energy and Industrial Technology Organization (NEDO, Japan)New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)","This work was supported under Fundamental study on rapid evaluation method of SOFC durability by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Organization (NEDO, Japan).",,33,7,7,3,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-7753,1873-2755,,J POWER SOURCES,J.

Fabrication process of MT-SOFCs is one of the critical factor that ensures the success of a cell. There are three main components (i.e. anode, electrolyte and cathode) in the development of MT-SOFCs which are generally fabricated through separated and multiple laborious steps. This study aims to produce a novel anode/electrolyte/cathode (NiO-CGO/CGO/LSCF-CGO) triple-layer hollow fiber (TLHF) in a single-step using phase inversion based co-extrusion combined with co-sintering technique. The challenge lies within the diverse sintering behaviors among the anode, electrolyte and cathode layers at some point of the cell fabrication. In this study, the TLHF was found being able to survive the co-sintering at 1450 degrees C resulting a defect free precursor producing 0.48 Wcm(-2) maximum power densities at 525 degrees C, which is comparable with the cell fabricated using conventional multiple-step process.

Bio-electricity generations by MFC have gained considerable attention due to its integration with wastewater treatment. The objectives of the work are to determine the optimisation of MEC's bio-electrochemical process using three different factors and its interaction, and to determine the optimal pH value for acidogenic, acetogenic and methanogenic by natural mixed culture electroactive bacteria (exoelectrogens) growth in presence and absence of oxygen using MFC. The two-level factorial design is used in order to achieve the main two objectives. The current generation, power generation and maximum power have been monitored. Experimental result shows that the best interaction between these three factors is (-+-) interaction which is the interaction between tryptic soya broth (TSB), sodium hydroxide as pH controller and resistant of 200 Omega, and the interaction yield the power density of 57.44 mA m(-2). The effects between those interactions also have been analysed. The interaction of all parameters that have been used in this experiment is given out the highest significant effect which is a value of effect of 24.56 with a significant F-value of 29.51.

The polyol synthesis was studied considering the influence of the platinum precursor, oxidation level of graphite oxide and pH of reaction medium. The as-prepared catalysts were analyzed using thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The best results in terms of platinum particle size and distribution were obtained when the synthesis was performed in acidic medium, using chloroplatinic acid as precursor and using graphene oxide with high oxidation level. The most promising graphene-supported catalyst was used to prepare a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell electrode. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) prepared with graphene-based electrode was compared with a MEA prepared with catalyst based on commercial platinum supported in carbon black (Pt/C). Single cell characterization included polarization curves and in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The graphene-based electrode presented promising albeit unstable electrochemical performance due to water management issues. Additionally, EIS measurements revealed that the MEA made with Pt/rGO catalyst presented a lower mass transport resistance than the commercial Pt/C.

Transition metal-containing perovskite oxide is attractive in this regard. The OER on such perovskite oxide in an alkaline solution is nonetheless often limited by proton transfer step. To overcome such limitation, here we apply mixed protonic-electronic conductor BaCo(0.8-x)FexZr(0.1)Y(0.1)O(3) (x = 0, 0.2, and 0.4) as an OER catalyst. Among these three, BaCo0.8Zr0.1Y0.1O3 (BC(0.8)ZY) in particular shows the lowest OER overpotential, the lowest Tafel slope, the highest OER mass activity, and the highest OER specific activity, which surpass those of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) benchmark. Using O-2-temperature programmed desorption, impedance spectroscopy, and O1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we attribute such superior OER performance to the highest oxygen desorption capacity, the lowest charge transfer resistance, and the highest hydroxide species content for BC(0.8)ZY. We also demonstrate that the OER current of BC(0.8)ZY exhibits a first-reaction order dependence to the solution pH between 12.5 and 14, which confirms its proton transfer rate-determining step.

The mechanical and thermal behaviours of the as-developed material were investigated in terms of the effects of temperature on the morphological, mechanical and electrical properties. It was observed that the flexural strength of the MWCNT/NG/EP composite decreased with increasing temperature. The highest flexural strength (27.05 MPa) was recorded at 25 degrees C. When heated to 200 degrees C, the flexural strength of the material decreased by up to 2.40 MPa. The shore hardness of the MWCNT/NG/EP composite decreased with increasing temperature. The highest shore hardness (69.7 HD) was recorded at a temperature of 25 degrees C, while the lowest shore hardness (31.3 HD) was recorded at 200 degrees C. The temperature-dependent through-plane and in-plane electrical conductivities of the MWCNT/NG/EP composite were also investigated, although its contact, bulk and forward resistivity values were found to decrease. The experimental results revealed that the effect of temperature on the thermal and mechanical properties of the bipolar plate material was different at different temperatures. The synergistic electrical nature of the as-designed material may be ascribed to the phenomenon of electron transfer among the channels of natural graphite and MWCNTs. The enhanced mechanical behaviour was attributed to the presence of EP in the composite material.","[Akhtar, Majid Niaz] MNSUET, Dept Phys, Multan 60000, Pakistan; [Sulong, Abu Bakar] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Umer, A.] Muhammad Nawaz Sharif Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Multan, Pakistan; [Bin Yousaf, Ammar] Qatar Univ, Ctr Adv Mat, Doha 2713, Qatar; [Khan, Muhammad Azhar] Islamia Univ Bahawalpur, Dept Phys, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan","Akhtar, MN (corresponding author), MNSUET, Dept Phys, Multan 60000, Pakistan.; Khan, MA (corresponding author), Islamia Univ Bahawalpur, Dept Phys, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.",azhan.khan@iub.edu.pk; majidniazalchtar@mnsuet.edu.pk,"Akhtar, Majid Niaz/AAI-4873-2020","Sulong, Abu Bakar/0000-0003-4637-1758; Akhtar, Majid Niaz/0000-0002-5121-0062","Ministry of Education of Malaysia [DIP-2014-006, LRGS-USM-UKM/PT/05]",We acknowledge the financial support provided by the Ministry of Education of Malaysia under Grant Nos.

Ceramic (Ce0.8Sm0.2-xErxO2-delta; x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) electrolytes were synthesized via sol-gel assisted citric acid-nitrate combustion and calcined at 850 degrees C for 5 h. The calcined electrolytes possessed a cubic fluorite crystal structure without impure phases. The direct band gap of the calcined electrolytes increased as the erbium content increased and the lowest band gap was obtained for Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC) electrolyte. The calcined electrolyte powders were subsequently pressed into cylindrical pellets by uniaxial die pressing, and the pellets were sintered at 1400 degrees C for 5 h. The sintered densities of the pellets were measured with Archimedes' method. The relative density of Ce(0.8)Sm(0.1)Er(0.1)O(2-delta )co-doped ceria electrolyte was higher than those of singly doped ones, and these findings were further confirmed through field emission scanning electron microscopy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that the conductivity of erbium-doped ceria increased as the samarium content increased. The maximum total ionic conductivity was observed in Ce0.8Sm0.1Er0.1O2-delta co-doped electrolyte. However, the singly doped SDC electrolyte exhibited the highest ionic conductivity of 13.12 mS/cm and the lowest activation energy of 0.580 eV at 600 degrees C among all other Ce0.8Sm0.2-xErxO2-delta co-doped ceria electrolytes.","[Anwar, Mustafa; Ali, Muhammed S.

The effects of zinc oxide filler on polyvinyl alcohol/alkaline solid polymer electrolyte for aluminum-air battery applications have been investigated. From the impedance measurement, the highest ionic conductivity achieved was 1.61 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) by PVA/4 wt% ZnO/2 M KOH at room temperature. From XRD analysis, crystallinity intensity decreased when KOH was added into the system. The FTIR also showed that the O-H and C-O bonds shifted to a high wavenumber, from 3282 to 3383 cm(-1) and 1092 to 1103 cm(-1), respectively, as the KOH concentration increased, which strengthened the bonding in the film. Thus, LSV analysis showed that the highest stability achieved by PVA/4 wt% ZnO/2 M KOH was +/- 2.15 V, which proved that this film is suitable in aluminum-air battery applications. Furthermore, in the aluminum-air coin cell, the longest discharge voltage time was achieved by PVA/4 wt% ZnO/2 M KOH in which the cell voltage was maintained at 1.49 to 1.53 V for almost 20 hours at 0.8 mA/cm(2).

Moreover, a kinetic model was constructed to identify the desirable conditions for biofuel synthesis. Three original contributions were concluded. First, this work confirmed that bisabolene was partially synthesized independently of biomass growth, indicating its feasibility for continuous production. Second, it was found that while bisabolene synthesis was independent of light intensity, it was strongly affected by temperature, resulting in conflicting desirable conditions for cell growth and product synthesis. Finally, through model prediction, optimal operating conditions were identified for mutant growth and bisabolene synthesis.

The MFC performance was evaluated in terms of voltage production, COD and sulfide removal efficiency. The HRT range tested were 7 days, 8 days and 9 days whereas the MLSS range tested were 1500 mg/L, 2000 mg/L and 2500 mg/L. From the study, HRT of 9 days was the optimum HRT for the MFC operation with the highest COD and sulfide removal efficiency of 98% and 98.98% respectively. The removal efficiency increased with increasing HRT. In terms of voltage production, the highest achievable voltage was 82.1 mV obtained at HRT of 9 days. The overall energy production trend shows that energy production was increased with increasing HRT. For MLSS study, the optimum MLSS for the MFC operation was at 1500 mg/L with the highest COD removal and sulfide removal efficiency of 94.07% and 89.01% respectively.

The electrochemical characterization results showed that the PVP-MnO2/CNT possessed the higher ORR catalytic activity with lower charge transfer resistance compared to MnO2 and MnO2/CNT. The performance of the electrocatalysts as cathode was evaluated in air-cathode MFC and it was found that the MFC with MnO2-PVP/CNT electrocatalyst generated a maximum power density of 1365.30 mW/m(3), which was higher than that of MFCs with MnO2/CNT catalyst (1083.98 mW/m(3)), MnO2 (540.91 mW/m(3)) and CNT (438.47 mW/m(3)). Therefore, the viable synthetic strategy and proposed application of PVP-MnO2/CNT will broaden up the reality of MFC for power generation.","[Ong, Huei Ruey] DRB HICOM Univ Automot Malaysia, Fac Engn & Technol, Pekan 26607, Pahang, Malaysia; [Woon, Chee Wai; Ahmad, Muhammad Sheraz; Cheng, Chin Kui; Khan, Md Maksudur Rahman] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Chem & Nat Resources Engn, Kuantan 26300, Pahang, Malaysia; [Yousuf, Abu] Shahjalal Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem Engn & Polymer Sci, Sylhet 3114, Bangladesh","Khan, MMR (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Chem & Nat Resources Engn, Kuantan 26300, Pahang, Malaysia.",mrkhancep@yahoo.com,"Ong, Huei Ruey/AAJ-2032-2020; Abu Yousuf/F-6455-2012; Ahmad, Muhammad sheraz/AAI-6026-2020; Khan, Maksudur Rahman/D-9837-2017","Abu Yousuf/0000-0003-4105-3937; Ahmad, Muhammad sheraz/0000-0001-5123-952X; Khan, Maksudur Rahman/0000-0001-6594-5361; Ong, Huei Ruey/0000-0003-2238-4458","Universiti Malaysia Pahang [RDU 140322]; Ministry of Higher Education, MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [RDU 150118]","The authors would like to thank Universiti Malaysia Pahang (RDU 140322) and Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia (RDU 150118) for the Research Funding.",,27,3,3,0,22,ESG,BELGRADE,"BORIVOJA STEVANOVICA 25-7, BELGRADE, 11000, SERBIA",1452-3981,,,INT J ELECTROCHEM SC,Int.

The low-cost cathodes of titanium-nickel (Ti/Ni) and graphite felt-nickel (GF/Ni) are important to be evaluated as cathodes for MFCs. In this study, Ni particles are deposited onto the Ti and GF surface using a simple and low-cost electrodeposition technique. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to analyse the cathode surfaces. The electrodeposition of Ni onto GF appears more uniform without significant agglomeration compared with that onto Ti. This uniform deposition is perhaps the reason for a higher maximum power density (P-max), lower internal resistance (R-in) and higher Columbic efficiency (CE) for MFC with GF/Ni cathode (113.4 +/- 0.6 mW/m(2), 1264.4 Omega and 29.6%, respectively) than those measured with Ti/Ni cathode (110.7 +/- 8.0 mW/m(2), 3375.8 Omega and 23.7%, respectively). However, the performance of these cathodes remains lower compared with the GF/Pt cathode (140.0 mW/m(2), 845.7 Omega and 42.0%, respectively). Based on the preparation technique, material cost and performance, both Ti/Ni and GF/Ni cathodes can be considered as alternative to Pt catalyst for MFC application.

The efficiency of solar technology, e.g. photovoltaic panels, thermal systems or a combination of both technologies as photovoltaic thermal is a concern to increase at an optimum level. A three-dimensional numerical analysis of PVT systems using water and MWCNT-water nanofluid has been completed with FEM based software COMSOL Multiphysics. A numerical investigation has been validated by the indoor experimental research at different mass flow rates of 30 to 120 L/h while keeping solar irradiation fixed at 1000 W/m(2), inlet fluid and ambient temperature at 32 and 25 degrees C, respectively. Percent improvement of electrical efficiency of PV with nanofluid cooling at flow rate 120 L/h is obtained about 10.72 and 12.25% of numerical and experimental cases respectively. Optimization of the nanofluid for weight concentration is achieved at 0.75% MWCNT-water. Solar cell temperature reduces about 0.72 degrees C experimentally and 0.77 degrees C numerically per 10 L/h flow rate increment. Approximately 7.74 and 6.89 W thermal energy is enhanced per 10 L/h flow rate increment in numerical and experimental studies respectively. Percentage increment of thermal efficiency is found as 5.62% numerically and 5.13% experimentally for PVT system operated by water/MWCNT nanofluid with compared to water.","[Fayaz, H.; Nasrin, R.; Rahim, N.

The fate of electrons in MFC for azo dye decolourisation and bioelectricity generation were explored via a series of studies including the effects of azo dye concentration, organic loading, external resistance and hydraulic retention time. The addition of low concentration of New Coccine (NC) (25 mg/L) improved 17% of the power density to 20.13 +/- 0.37 W/m(3). The internal resistance decreased from 50 to 32 Omega. As dye concentration increases, the decolourisation efficiency maintained over 90% (200 mg/L NC), whereas, power density dropped to 10.83 +/- 1.21 W/m(3). The increase of NC to higher concentration hindered the bioelectricity production, as both anode and azo dye molecules were competing for electrons. More electrons were utilized for decolourisation than bioelectricity generation as decolourisation efficiency improved, but power density dropped with the increase of organic loading. Lower external resistance allowed greater electron transfer, thus it enhanced the overall power performance. Higher power density (15.12 +/- 1.12 W/m(3)) and normalized energy recovery (76 Wh/kg COD) were achieved at the lowest external resistance of 100 Omega. Both decolourisation and power performances were improved with 2 days HRT. The intermediate products from decolourisation and mineralization processes were identified, and the degradation pathway of NC has been proposed based on the UV-Vis, HPLC and GC-MS results.","[Oon, Yoong-Sin; Ong, Soon-An; Wong, Yee-Shian; Oon, Yoong-Ling; Lehl, Harvinder Kaur; Thung, Wei-Eng] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Environm Engn, Water Res Grp WAREG, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia; [Ho, Li-Ngee; Nordin, Noradiba] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Mat Engn, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia","Ong, SA (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Environm Engn, Water Res Grp WAREG, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia.",saong@unimap.edu.my,"Lehl, Harvinder Kaur/AAK-6862-2020; Oon, Yoong Sin/AAK-2103-2020; Oon, Yoong-Ling/AAK-2058-2020; Ho, Li Ngee/I-4614-2017; Thung, Wei-Eng/Z-5447-2019; NORDIN, NORADIBA/AAK-2523-2020","Thung, Wei-Eng/0000-0002-8701-4899; Oon, Yoong-Ling/0000-0001-6612-6739; YEE-SHIAN, WONG/0000-0002-6238-5247; Nordin, Noradiba/0000-0003-0215-0769; Oon, Yoong-Sin/0000-0001-6581-8194; Lehl, Harvin/0000-0002-5322-4492","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI), MalaysiaMinistry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia [02-01-15-SF0201]","This research was supported by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI), Malaysia, Science Fund (Grant number. 02-01-15-SF0201).

Besides, water formation through four-electron oxygen reduction mechanism is a commonly observed product. Determining the selectivity of H2O2/H2O reaction through experimental means is time consuming because of the slow kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction. Therefore, quantum chemical approaches are essential to comprehend the molecular nature of this process. Thus, density functional theory (DFT) was employed and quantum chemical calculations were performed to predict the chemical reactivity, stability, and thermodynamic properties of molecules participating in oxygen reduction reaction at graphite cathode. The calculations showed that graphene with higher value of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), i.e., -4.544 eV has a higher tendency to donate electron for oxygen reduction reaction Furthermore, with an aim of predicting the most favorable conditions for H2O2 production, two different points, i.e., at the edge and middle of graphene plane were investigated. Calculated values showed that oxygen adsorption with the lowest energy requirement of 43.638 kcal/mol is energetically favorable at the edge of graphene plane. Nevertheless, oxygen complexes (O-2*, HOO*, and HO*) characterized by high HOMO values -4.96, -4.37, and -4.34 eV are highly polarizable in the middle of the graphene plane. Furthermore, thermodynamic feasibility analysis showed that oxygen reduction required for hydrogen peroxide production had lower G values of -90.94 (edge) and -98.44 (middle) kcal/mole than that of water synthesis (i.e., G=-48.37(edge), -48.97 (middle) kcal/mole) at two-electron reduction step. Therefore, it was concluded that H2O2 which followed the lowest energy pathway would be more thermodynamically feasible compared to water synthesis.

The introduction of RB5 in anode chamber increased the voltage generation in the system since degradation of RB5 might produce electrons which also would transfer through external circuit to the cathode chamber. The removal efficiency of RB5 with open and closed circuit was 8.5% and 13.6%, respectively and removal efficiency for open circuit was low due to the fact that recombination of electron-hole pairs might happen in anode chamber since without connection to the cathode, electron cannot be transferred. The degradation of RB5 in cathode chamber with absence of oxygen showed that electrons from anode chamber was accepted by dye molecules to break its azo bond. The presence of oxygen in cathode chamber would improve the oxygen reduction rate which occurred at Platinum-loaded carbon (Pt/C) cathode electrode. The V-oc, J(sc) and P-max for different condition of ultrapure water at cathode chamber also affected their fill factor.

The proposed model not only considers the stack output voltage but also provides valid waveforms of component voltages, such as the no-load, activation, ohmic, and concentration voltages of the PEMFC stack system. Experiments under no-load, ramping load, and dynamic load conditions are performed to obtain various voltage components. According to experimental results, model parameters are optimised using the lightning search algorithm by providing valid theoretical ranges of parameters to the lightning search algorithm code. In addition, the correlation between the vapour and water pressures of the PEMFC is obtained to model the component voltages. Finally, all component voltages and the stack output voltage are validated by using the experimental/theoretical waveforms mentioned in previous research. The proposed model is also compared with a recently developed semiempirical model of PEMFC through particle swarm optimisation. The proposed dynamic model may be used in future in-depth studies on PEMFC behaviour and in dynamic applications for health monitoring and fault diagnosis.","[Khan, Saad S.; Shareef, Hussain; Wahyudie, Addy] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Elect Engn, POB 15551, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Khalid, S.

The effect of the initial pH value (5.5, 6.5 and 7.5) as well as the type of carbon precursors on the structural properties of Co-CX was investigated via field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The catalytic activity of Co-CX for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 M KOH was studied using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. The structural properties and ORR activities were affected by different initial pH values as well as the type of carbon precursor. A carbon precursor consisting of resorcinol-formaldehyde with an initial pH value of 7.5 exhibited the best catalytic activity. The initial pH plays an important role in promoting micro/mesopores. The FESEM and BET results revealed that Co doping promotes the formation of additional pores. The RRDE result indicated that Co-CX exhibited good catalytic activity that tends to favour a four-electron pathway. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the decomposition of the unrequired intermediate compounds in the precalcined powder was completed at 800 A degrees C. A single LSC perovskite phase was formed at a calcination temperature of 900 A degrees C, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The particle size, crystallite size, and BET-specific surface area of the powder are 219-221 nm, 18 nm, and 9.87 m(2) g(-1), respectively. The high index value of the extent of agglomeration (5.53) showed that the powder was barely agglomerated. Bulk LSC sintered at 1200 A degrees C for 2 h showed the highest direct-current electrical conductivity (sigma (d.c)) compared to that of bulk LSC sintered at 1000 A degrees C and 1100 A degrees C. The value of sigma (d.c) was affected by the density and porosity of the sintered samples. The area specific resistance (ASR) of screen-printed LSC working on a proton conductor of BaCe0.54Zr0.36Y0.1O2.95 (BCZY) decreased from 5.0 Omega cm(2)-0.06 Omega cm(2) as the temperature increased from 500 A degrees C to 800 A degrees C with an activation energy of 1.079 eV. Overall, in this work, the LSC material produced with the aid of activated carbon meet the requirements for the application as a cathode in an intermediate temperature H+-SOFC.

An effective thermal management is needed to preserve the fuel cell performance and durability. Cooling by water is a conventional approach for PEMFC. Balance between optimal operating temperature, temperature uniformity and fast cooling response is a continuous issue in the thermal management of PEMFC. Various cooling strategies have been proposed for water-cooled PEMFC and an approach to obtain a fast cooling response was tested by feeding the coolant at a high temperature. In this paper, the operating behaviour was characterized from the perspectives of temperature profiles, mean temperature difference, and cooling response time. A 2.4 kW water-cooled PEMFC was used and the electrical load ranged from 40 A-90 A. The operating coolant temperature was set to 50 degrees C where the maximum stack operating temperature is 60 degrees C. The stack temperature profiles, cooling response time, mean temperature difference and cooling rates to the load variation was analysed. The analysis showed that the strategy allowed a fast cooling response especially at high current densities, but it also promotes a large temperature gradient across the stack.

Removal of tar to acceptable tolerance limits for Internal Combustion (IC) engines and fuel cells is one of the major limitations and considered the main obstacle to the wide commercial power generation using biomass producer gas. If tar is not removed to the required levels, it will condense at low temperatures and result in clogging and fouling of engines. Even though physical tar removal at low temperatures has been performing effectively with the technical and economical point of view, there is still need to explore new and more efficient tar removal techniques. In this work, compression of producer gas in a compressor is introduced as a tar cleaning mechanism of biomass tar. Compressor was exposed to low tar levels in the range of 138-312 +/- 31 mg Nm(-3) after the cooling and pre-cleaning system. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the compression process in reducing tar by 84.4 +/- 1.2% and 83 +/- 1.1% when compressed to 0.8 MPag and 0.2 MPag respectively at ambient temperature. The blue colour flare after the compression indicates the clean producer gas from tar and corresponds to the total tar levels around and below 30 mg Nm(-3) with negligible particulates in the producer gas as compared to the orange flare before the compression. It was found that tar condenses inside the compressor receiver tank. A mechanism explaining the condensation of tar in the compression process is proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparison with a commercial catalyst (TEC10V30E) with similar Pt content was also carried out. In EIS, both the catalysts showed a single time-constant with an emerging high-frequency semicircle of very small diameter which was fitted using suitable equivalent circuits. The organically modified catalyst showed lower charge-transfer resistance and hence, low polarization resistance in high potential region as compared to the commercial catalyst. The dominance of kinetic processes was observed at 0.925-1.000 V, whereas domination of diffusion based processes was observed at lower potential region for the organic catalyst. No effect due to the presence of carbon was observed in the EIS spectra. Using the hydrodynamic method, higher current penetration depth was obtained for the organically modified catalyst at 1600 rpm. Exchange current density and Tafel slopes for both the electrocatalysts were calculated from the polarization resistance obtained from EIS which was in correlation with the results obtained from dc methods.","[Joshi, Prerna; Okada, Toshihiko; Miyabayashi, Keiko] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Sci & Technol, Dept Engn, Shizuoka 4328561, Japan; [Miyake, Mikio] Univ Technol Malaysia, Malaysia Japan Int Inst Technol, Dept Environm Engn & Green Technol, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia","Miyabayashi, K (corresponding author), Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Sci & Technol, Dept Engn, Shizuoka 4328561, Japan.",miyabayashi.keiko@shizuoka.ac.jp,,"Joshi, Prerna/0000-0002-3157-1821","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), JapanNew Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)","This research was carried out under the framework of project financially supported by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Japan.",,53,5,5,0,58,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0003-2700,1520-6882,,ANAL CHEM,Anal.

Partial replacement of the original metal cation with another cation, namely, doping, can be used to tailor the ORR activity of perovskite, for which a metal has been exclusively used as the dopant component in the past. Herein, phosphorus is proposed as a non-metal dopant for the cation site to develop a new perovskite family with the formula of La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-xPxO3-delta (x=0, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1; denoted as LSM, LSMP0.02, LSMP0.05, and LSMP0.1, respectively). Powder XRD patterns reveal that the solubility of phosphorus in the perovskite structure is around 0.05. Rotating ring-disk electrode experiments in the form of linear-sweep voltammetry scans demonstrated the best ORR performance for LSMP0.05, and also revealed close to a four-electron ORR pathway for all four compositions. A chronoamperometric test (9000 s) and 500 cycle accelerated durability test demonstrated higher durability for LSMP0.05 relative to that of LSM and the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. The higher ORR activity for LSMP0.05 is attributed to the optimised average valence of Mn, as evidenced by combined X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy data. Doping phosphorus into perovskites is an effective way to develop high-performance electrocatalysts for ORR.","[Shen, Yujuan; Zhu, Yinlong; Guan, Daqin; Liu, Bo; Liu, Hong; Zhou, Wei; Shao, Zongping] Jiangsu Natl Synerget Innovat Ctr Adv Mat SICAM, 5 Xin Mofan Rd, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shen, Yujuan; Zhu, Yinlong; Guan, Daqin; Liu, Bo; Liu, Hong; Zhou, Wei; Shao, Zongping] Nanjing Tech Univ, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, 5 Xin Mofan Rd, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shen, Yujuan; Zhu, Yinlong; Guan, Daqin; Liu, Bo; Liu, Hong; Zhou, Wei; Shao, Zongping] Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem Engn, 5 Xin Mofan Rd, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Sunarso, Jaka] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Res Ctr Sustainable Technol, Jalan Simpang Tiga, Kuching 93350, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Shao, Zongping] Curtin Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Perth, WA 6845, Australia","Zhou, W; Shao, ZP (corresponding author), Jiangsu Natl Synerget Innovat Ctr Adv Mat SICAM, 5 Xin Mofan Rd, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Zhou, W; Shao, ZP (corresponding author), Nanjing Tech Univ, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, 5 Xin Mofan Rd, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Zhou, W; Shao, ZP (corresponding author), Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem Engn, 5 Xin Mofan Rd, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Shao, ZP (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",wei.zhou@uq.edu.au; shaozp@njtech.edu.cn,", 周嵬/B-1083-2012; , 朱印龙/J-7229-2019; Shao, Zongping/AAY-8177-2020; Sunarso, Jaka/B-9077-2008",", 周嵬/0000-0003-0322-095X; , 朱印龙/0000-0002-9207-2452; Shao, Zongping/0000-0002-4538-4218; Sunarso, Jaka/0000-0002-5234-7431",National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21576135]; Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars [BK20170043]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Program for Changjiang ScholarsProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT); Program for Jiangsu Specially Appointed Professors; Youth Fund in Jiangsu Province [BK20150945],"This work was financially supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (no. 21576135), Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (no.

One of the most significant parameters associated with this overvoltage is charge transfer coefficient (CTC). This study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by investigating the effects of operating temperature and CTC on the overall operating voltage. This study also provides an important opportunity to advance the understanding of the effect of different temperature and pressure on the CTC. The result of this study was successfully compared with experimental data. The simulation result shows that, within the temperature range of 10 degrees C-90 degrees C, the CTC values at the anode electrode ranges between 0.807 and 1.035 while at the cathode electrode, the variation is only within 0.202-0.259. It was observed that activation overvoltage decreases when the CTC increase from 0.1 to 2.0 both at anode and cathode electrodes. Interestingly it was observed that the CTC remains the same even at balanced and unbalanced pressure. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, single chambered (SPMFC) were constructed and operated at different re-circulation flow rates (0, 40 and 240 ml/min) under bufferless conditions. Furthermore, maximum power density of 4.06 mW/m(2), current density of 46.34 mA/m(2) and open circuit potential of 0.43 V and low internal resistance of 611.8 Omega were obtained at 40 ml/min.

The MG comprises two 50 kW DGs (solid oxide fuel cells, SOFCs) interfaced using a power electronics-based voltage source inverter (VSI) with a 120-kV conventional grid. Four PI controller schemes for the MG are implemented: (i) stationary PI controller with fixed gain values (Kp and Ki), (ii) PSO tuned PI controller, (iii) GWO tuned PI controller, and (iv) WOA tuned PI controller. The performance of these controllers is evaluated by monitoring the system voltage and frequency during the transition of MG operation mode and changes in the load. The MATLAB/SIMULINK tool is utilised to design the proposed model of grid-tied MG alongside the MATLAB m-file to apply an optimisation technique. The simulation results show that the WOA-based PI controller which optimises the control parameters, achieve 62.7% and 59% better results for voltage and frequency regulation, respectively. The eigenvalue analysis is also provided to check the stability of the proposed controller.

A twin-screw extruder was used at a temperature of 230 degrees C and a rotational speed of 50 rpm before the compression molding process was carried out at 200 degrees C and 13 kPa. This research examined different die configurations, namely rod and sheet dies. The results indicated that the rod dies showed better mechanical properties and electrical conductivity with 25 MPa and 5 S/cm compared to the sheet dies. Moreover, rod dies are able to orientate to 86 degrees and obtain longest filler length with 55 m compared to the sheet dies.

The VPP and MGs models are simulated and tested based on real parameters and loads data recorded in Perlis, Malaysia, employed on each bus of the system for 24 h. BBSA optimization algorithm provides the best binary fitness function, i.e., global minimum fitness for finding the best cell to generate the optimal schedule. The fitness function is generated based on real conditions such as solar irradiation and wind speed and preparation of battery charge/discharges, fuel states and demand of the specific hour. The obtained results show that the BBSA algorithm provides the best schedule to control DGs ON and OFF based on controller decision. Results obtained from the BBSA are compared with binary particle swarm optimization in terms of objective function and power saving to validate the developed controller.

This study investigates the microstructural, optical, mechanical, and electrical properties of an LSCF-samarium-doped ceria (SDC) composite cathode. LSCF-SDC composite cathode powders were prepared by mixing 50 wt% SDC electrolyte with LSCF cathode powders obtained by the rotary evaporation technique. The band gap of the prepared powders was determined via diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectroscopy. The chemical composition, mechanical properties, and electrochemical properties of the sintered pellets were characterized using Raman spectroscopy, Vickers hardness, and impedance spectroscopy, respectively. X-ray diffraction and Rietveld analysis showed that phase purity was only 96%. Moreover, a small fraction of tetragonal phase impurity was observed on the LSCF powders. Impurities significantly affected the phase stability and microstructure of the LSCF-SDC composite cathode. The addition of the SDC electrolyte enhanced the densification of the composite cathode, thereby improving mechanical properties. However, the addition of SDC exerted different effects on the DC electrical conductivity and area-specific resistance (ASR) of the composite cathode. At 800 A degrees C, the ASR value of the LSCF was only 2% that of the LSCF-SDC composite cathode. Overall, the electrical properties of the LSCF-SDC composite cathode are closely related to the crystal structure, purity, and microstructure of LSCF cathode powders. [GRAPHICS] .","[Ali, Muhammed S.

High concentration of CO2 lead to a limitation especially in fuel cell application. In this study, the amine-mixed oxide hybrid materials for CO2 separation from bio-hydrogen model (50% CO2: 50% H-2) have been studied. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) characterizations showed that the amine-mixed oxide hybrid materials successfully adsorbed CO2 physically with no chemical adsorption evidence. The dry gas of CO2/H-2 mixture adsorbed physically on amine-CuO-MgO-hybrid material. No carbonates were detected after several times of adsorption, which indicated the good recyclability of adsorbents. The adsorbent system of diethanolamine (DEA)/15% CuO-75% MgO showed the highest CO2 adsorption capacity of 21.2 wt% due to the presence of polar substance on MgO surface, which can adsorb CO2 at ambient condition. The alcohol group of DEA can enhance the CO2 solubility on the adsorbent surface. In the 20% CuO-50% MgO adsorbent system, DEA as amine type showed a high CO2 adsorption of 19.4 wt%. The 10% amine loading system showed that the DEA adsorption system provided high CO2 adsorption. The BET analysis confirmed that a high amine loading contributed to the decrease in CO2 adsorption due to the low surface area of the adsorbent system.","[Ravi, Navin; Anuar, Siti Aishah; Yusuf, Nur Yusra Mt; Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan; Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ctr Sustainable Proc Technol CESPRO, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan; Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Chem Engn Programme, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia","Isahak, WNRW (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ctr Sustainable Proc Technol CESPRO, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.; Isahak, WNRW (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Chem Engn Programme, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",wannorroslam@ukm.edu.my,"Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin/M-2008-2016; Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin/AAA-7572-2019; Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan/C-6454-2015","Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin/0000-0001-5714-7415; Masdar, Mohd Shahbudin/0000-0001-5714-7415; Isahak, Wan Nor Roslam Wan/0000-0002-1051-3120","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) [GUP-2016-057, DIP-2016-010]","2This work was supported by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) under research grant number GUP-2016-057 and DIP-2016-010.

Then, the decolorization capability and fungal biomass were evaluated using different dye concentrations, namely, 0, 50, 75 and 100 ppm. Effects of the carbon sources (fructose, glucose, and galactose), nitrogen sources (ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate and yeast extract), surfactant (tween 80), aromatic compounds (benzoic acid, catechol and salicylic acid), and pH on the decolorization efficiency were examined. This study has found that the employed carbon sources, nitrogen sources, and aromatic compounds strongly enhance the decolorization efficiency. In addition, increasing the surfactant volume and pH generally decreased the decolorization efficiencies from 19.5 to 9.0% and 81.7 to 60.5%, respectively.

Plasma spraying can replace the traditional use of extrusion technology to manufacture the anode base tube, eliminating the need for high-temperature sintering steps. In this study, commercially available powders were used to make the anode of a tubular SOFC from NiO/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) powder, and Na2CO3 and polymethyl methacrylate were tested as pore-forming agents. The anode composite powder was sprayed on the graphite base pipe, and the final product was changed by altering the spraying parameters and anode powder ratio. The direct current (DC) resistance measurements showed that the conductivity of the Ni/YSZ tubular anode formed with higher power plasma spraying could reach 428.55 S/cm at 800 degrees C. The experimental results showed that the power and parameters of atmospheric plasma spraying could affect the porosity and electron conductivity of tubular SOFC anodes.","[Yang, Yung-Chin; Wang, Po-Hao; Tsai, Yu-Ting] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Mat Sci & Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Ong, Hwai-Chyuan] Univ Malaya, Dept Mech Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Yang, YC (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Mat Sci & Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",ycyang@ntut.edu.tw,"Ong, Hwai Chyuan/A-9492-2013","Ong, Hwai Chyuan/0000-0002-6731-4800","Ministry of Science and Technology in TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 105-2221-E-027-092]","Authors thank financial support from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan under Contrast No. MOST 105-2221-E-027-092.

The ammonia decomposer is assumed to be located next to the SOFCs, and the heat required for the endothermic decomposition reaction is supplied by the thermal radiation from the SOFCs. Cells with aspect ratios (ratios of the streamwise length to the spanwise width) between 0.130 and 7.68 are provided with the reactants at a constant mass flow rate. A parametric study is conducted by varying the cell temperature and fuel utility factor to investigate their effects on the cell performance in terms of the voltage efficiency. The effect of the heat supply to the ammonia decomposer is also studied. The developed model shows good agreement, in terms of the current-voltage curve, with the experimental data obtained from a short stack without parameter tuning. The simulation study reveals that the cell with the highest aspect ratio achieves the highest performance under furnace operation. On the other hand, the 0.750 aspect ratio cell with the highest voltage efficiency of 0.67 is capable of thermally sustaining the ammonia decomposers at a fuel utility of 0.80 using the thermal radiation from both sidewalls.","[Tan, Wee Choon; Iwai, Hiroshi; Kishimoto, Masashi; Yoshida, Hideo] Kyoto Univ, Dept Aeronaut & Astronaut, Nishikyo Ku, Kyoto 6158540, Japan; [Tan, Wee Choon] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Mechatron Engn, Perlis 02600, Malaysia; [Brus, Grzegorz; Szmyd, Janusz S.] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Fundamental Res Energy Engn, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland","Tan, WC (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Aeronaut & Astronaut, Nishikyo Ku, Kyoto 6158540, Japan.",tweechoon@unimap.edu.my,"Brus, Grzegorz/S-2491-2017; Szmyd, Janusz/T-3277-2018; Tan, Wee Choon/D-2550-2015","Brus, Grzegorz/0000-0003-4911-5880; Szmyd, Janusz/0000-0002-4490-9502; Tan, Wee Choon/0000-0002-0615-9800","Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), Energy Carrier (Funding agency: JST); PAN-JSPS Joint Research Project Mechanism behind degradation in SOFCs - from nano to macro-scale; Polish National Science Centre [2015/19/D/ST8/00839]","This work was partially supported by the Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), Energy Carrier (Funding agency: JST), by the PAN-JSPS Joint Research Project Mechanism behind degradation in SOFCs - from nano to macro-scale, and by the Polish National Science Centre (Grant no. 2015/19/D/ST8/00839).",,41,6,6,2,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-7753,1873-2755,,J POWER SOURCES,J.

Understanding mechanical characteristics of SWCNTs with hydrogen interactions are urgently important for providing solid groundwork to design robust and effective on-board hydrogen storage systems for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). This study analyses impact of SWNCTs' geometry, weight percentage of hydrogen storage, temperature variation and vacancy defects. It is obtained that effect of hydrogen storage increases compressive resistance of SWCNTs. Furthermore, temperature increase and presence of defects negatively impacts compressive strength of SWCNTs. The compressive resistance of hydrogen stored SWCNTs were also found to depend on inter-molecular spacing of hydrogen molecules. It is expected that this work could provide important fundamentals in understanding mechanical behaviour of hydrogen stored SWNCTs subjected to compression that could assist in the development of effective on-board hydrogen storage systems for fuel cells.

In this paper, findings on the thermo-electrical performance of a liquid-cooled PEM fuel cell with the adoption of Al2O3 nanofluids were established. Thermo-physical properties of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5% volume concentration of Al2O3 nanoparticles dispersed in water and water: Ethylene glycol (EG) mixtures of 60:40 were measured and then adopted in PEM fuel cell as cooling medium. The result shows that the cooling rate improved up to 187% with the addition of 0.5% volume concentration of Al2O3 nanofluids to the base fluid of water. This is due to the excellent thermal conductivity property of nanofluids as compared to the base fluid. However, there was a penalty of higher pressure drop and voltage drop experienced. Thermo electrical ratio (TER) and Advantage ratio (AR) were then established to evaluate the feasibility of Al2O3 nanofluid adoption in PEM fuel cells in terms of both electrical and thermo-fluid performance considering all aspects including heat transfer enhancement, fluid flow and PEM fuel cell performance. Upon analysis of these two ratios, 0.1% volume concentration of Al2O3 dispersed in water shows to be the most feasible nanofluid for adoption in a liquid-cooled PEM fuel cell. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate and enhance the performance under different operational conditions which affect the chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction and power generation, including the increase of KCl concentration (MFC1) and COD concentration (MFC2). The results showed that the increase of KCl concentration is an important factor in up-flow membrane-less MFC to enhance the ease of electron transfer from anode to cathode. The increase of COD concentration in MFC2 could led to the drop of voltage output due to the prompt of biofilm growth in MFC2 cathode which could increase the internal resistance. It also showed that the COD concentration is a vital issue in up-flow membrane-less MFC. Despite the COD reduction was up to 96%, the power output remained constrained.

These tests confirm that the ultrasonic spraying is a suitable method for the fabricating DFAFC anodes. Palladium black was used for the anode catalyst and a commercially available Pt/C cathode electrode was used for all tests. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed deep cracks caused by the porous substrate in the catalyst layers prepared by DP and by ultrasonic spraying on the diffusion layer. However, catalyst layers prepared by ultrasonic spraying directly on the membrane were less cracked and less porous, with small Pd particles. The catalyst layer prepared by ultrasonic spraying directly on the membrane showed the highest electrochemical surface area (ECSA) among the three anodes. In performance tests, ultrasonic spraying on the membrane yielded the highest power output because it produces the lowest ohmic resistance, the lowest anode potential, and the highest ECSA. By coating the catalyst membrane directly with ultrasonic spraying, we prepared a DFAFC with maximum power density as high as 245 mW cm(-2) using 5 M formic acid with 2 mg cm(-2) of catalyst loading.

Although numerous bacteria isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated sites in Antarctica were able to demonstrate promising outcomes in utilising hydrocarbon components as their energy source, reports on the utilisation of hydrocarbons by strains isolated from pristine Antarctic soil are scarce. In the present work, two psychrotolerant strains isolated from Antarctic pristine soil with the competency to utilise diesel fuel as the sole carbon source were identified and optimised through conventional and response surface method. Results: Two potent hydrocarbon-degraders (ADL15 and ADL36) were identified via partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, and revealed to be closely related to the genus Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus sp., respectively. Factors affecting diesel degradation such as temperature, hydrocarbon concentration, pH and salt tolerance were studied. Although strain ADL36 was able to withstand a higher concentration of diesel than strain ADL15, both strains showed similar optimal condition for the cell's growth at pH 7.0 and 1.0% (w/v) NaCl at the conventional 'one-factor-at-a-time' level. Both strains were observed to be psychrotrophs with optimal temperatures of 20 degrees C. Qualitative and quantitative analysis were performed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionisation detector to measure the reduction of n-alkane components in diesel. In the pre-screening medium, strain ADL36 showed 83.75% of n-dodecane mineralisation while the reduction of n-dodecane by strain ADL15 was merely at 22.39%. The optimised condition for n-dodecane mineralisation predicted through response surface methodology enhanced the reduction of n-dodecane to 99.89 and 38.32% for strain ADL36 and strain ADL15, respectively. Conclusions: Strain ADL36 proves to be a better candidate for bioaugmentation operations on sites contaminated with aliphatic hydrocarbons especially in the Antarctic and other cold regions. The results obtained throughout strongly supports the use of RSM for medium optimisation.","[Habib, Syahir; Ahmad, Siti Aqlima; Abd Shukor, Mohd Yunus; Yasid, Nur Adeela] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Dept Biochem, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Johari, Wan Lutfi Wan] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Environm Studies, Dept Environm Sci, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Alias, Siti Aisyah] Univ Malaya, Inst Postgrad Studies C308, Inst Ocean & Earth Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Khalil, Khalilah Abdul] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Appl Sci, Dept Biomol Sci, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia","Yasid, NA (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Dept Biochem, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",adeela@upm.edu.my,"Johari, Wan Lutfi Wan/AAL-4095-2020; Yasid, Nur Adeela/AAL-8044-2020; ALIAS, SITI AISYAH A.

The performance of AO7 biodegradation in UFML MFC was evaluated by various operating configurations. This study demonstrated that the UFML MFC capable to sustain high decolorization efficiency throughout a long term operation. Besides, the obtained results illustrated that the AO7 decolorization would compete with exoelectrogens and other anaerobic microbial activities for electrons that released from the substrate. The decolorization efficiency of AO7 was ranging from 89% to 96% during operated in various configurations. However, the voltage output was highly affected as the AO7 dosage was increased. Therefore, these results indicated that most of the available electrons were more prone to be used by AO7 decolorization rather than voltage output. Moreover, the results suggested that the high AO7 dosage and continuous 24-h flow pattern could inhibit the other anaerobic microbial activities, and consequently more electrons can be used for AO7 decolorization and electricity generation. Furthermore, AO7 decomposition intermediates were further identified by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results demonstrated that the residual aromatic compounds from decomposition of AO7 were recalcitrant to be biodegraded in anaerobic region. However, the aromatic compounds can be further biodegraded in aerobic region. Therefore, the proposed biodegradation pathway showed the AO7 can be completely mineralized by using a combination of anaerobic-aerobic UFML MFC.","[Thung, Wei-Eng; Ong, Soon-An; Wong, Yee-Shian; Ridwan, Fahmi; Lehl, Harvinder Kaur; Oon, Yoong-Ling; Oon, Yoong-Sin] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Environm Engn, Water Res Grp WAREG, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia; [Ho, Li-Ngee] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Mat Engn, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia","Ong, SA (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Environm Engn, Water Res Grp WAREG, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia.",saong@unimap.edu.my,"Oon, Yoong Sin/AAK-2103-2020; Oon, Yoong-Ling/AAK-2058-2020; Fahmi, Muhammad Ridwan/F-5541-2011; Lehl, Harvinder Kaur/AAK-6862-2020; Ho, Li Ngee/I-4614-2017; Thung, Wei-Eng/Z-5447-2019","Fahmi, Muhammad Ridwan/0000-0001-6331-3678; Thung, Wei-Eng/0000-0002-8701-4899; Lehl, Harvin/0000-0002-5322-4492; YEE-SHIAN, WONG/0000-0002-6238-5247; Oon, Yoong-Sin/0000-0001-6581-8194; Oon, Yoong-Ling/0000-0001-6612-6739","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI), MalaysiaMinistry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia [02-01-15SF0201]; Ministry of Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of Science Fund (Grant No. 02-01-15SF0201) provided by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI), Malaysia and the MyBrain15 (MyPhD) Scholarhip from Ministry of Education Malaysia.",,55,35,36,4,63,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",1385-8947,1873-3212,,CHEM ENG J,Chem.

Its stable operation over long duration relies on the availability of CO2-resistant cathode materials with high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Here, we reported a novel perovskite oxide cathode SrSc0.075Ta0.025Fe0.9O3-delta (SSTF75), which provides CO2 resistance and high ORR activity. A peak power density of 1430 mW cm(-2) was achieved with the SSTF75/Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 cathode at 650 degrees C with a methane and oxygen gas mixture (1:1 v/v ratio). It retained stable voltage performance at 600 degrees C for an over 90 h duration when discharged at a current density of 1000 mA cm(-2). This work not only represents an advancing step in the SC-SOFC field but also authenticates an effective codoping strategy for the design of a CO2-resistant cathode for low-temperature applications.","[Zhang, Yuan; Gao, Xuechao; Liu, Bo; Zhou, Wei; Shao, Zongping] Nanjing Tech Univ, Jiangsu Natl Synerget Innovat Ctr Adv Mat SICAM, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuan; Liu, Bo; Zhou, Wei; Shao, Zongping] Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China; [Sunarso, Jaka] Swinburne Univ Technol, Res Ctr Sustainable Technol, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Jalan Simpang Tiga, Kuching 93350, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Ni, Meng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Shao, Zongping] Curtin Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Perth, WA 6845, Australia","Zhou, W; Shao, ZP (corresponding author), Nanjing Tech Univ, Jiangsu Natl Synerget Innovat Ctr Adv Mat SICAM, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China.; Zhou, W; Shao, ZP (corresponding author), Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China.; Shao, ZP (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",zhouwei1982@njtech.edu.cn; shaozp@njtech.edu.cn,"Sunarso, Jaka/B-9077-2008; Shao, Zongping/AAY-8177-2020; , 周嵬/B-1083-2012; Ni, Meng/D-3589-2009","Sunarso, Jaka/0000-0002-5234-7431; Shao, Zongping/0000-0002-4538-4218; , 周嵬/0000-0003-0322-095X; Ni, Meng/0000-0001-5310-4039; Gao, Xuechao/0000-0001-5925-8127",National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21576135]; Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars [BK20170043]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Program for Changjiang ScholarsProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT); Program for Jiangsu Specially Appointed Professors; Youth Fund in Jiangsu Province [BK20150945],"This work was financially supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (21576135), Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (BK20170043), the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, the Program for Changjiang Scholars, the Program for Jiangsu Specially Appointed Professors, and the Youth Fund in Jiangsu Province (BK20150945).",,44,15,17,2,15,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2574-0962,,,ACS APPL ENERG MATER,ACS Appl.

Herein, we report the characterization of high-performance BaScxCo1-xO3- (x=0, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.375) perovskite SOFC cathodes. Unlike BaCoO3-, which adopts 2H-hexagonal perovskite structure, the replacement of 25mol% of Co with Sc stabilizes the cubic structure, which also leads to the significant reduction in area specific resistances and their activation energies between 650 and 500 degrees C (for BaSc0.25Co0.75O3-) relative to the non-doped BaCoO3-. In this temperature range, BaSc0.25Co0.75O3- displayed a remarkably high ORR activity compared to Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3- (BSCF), the current cathode benchmark. We attribute such superior ORR performance to the higher oxygen non-stoichiometries of BaSc0.25Co0.75O3- relative to BSCF, which also translates to the higher oxygen bulk diffusion and surface exchange coefficients for the former compared to the latter. As a result, a single fuel cell based on an anode-supported 20m thick samarium-doped ceria electrolyte and BaSc0.25Co0.75O3- cathode achieved a very high peak power density of 1723mWcm(-2) at 650 degrees C. We also demonstrated the possibility to increase the ORR activity of the BaSc0.25Co0.75O3- cathode by impregnation of a low amount of silver.","[Liu, Bo; Zhang, Yuan; Yang, Guangming; Zhou, Wei; Shao, Zongping] Nanjing Tech Univ, Jiangsu Natl Synerget Innovat Ctr Adv Mat, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bo; Zhang, Yuan; Yang, Guangming; Zhou, Wei; Shao, Zongping] Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Sunarso, Jaka] Swinburne Univ Technol, Res Ctr Sustainable Technol, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Kuching 93350, Malaysia; [Shao, Zongping] Curtin Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Perth, WA 6845, Australia","Zhou, W; Shao, ZP (corresponding author), Nanjing Tech Univ, Jiangsu Natl Synerget Innovat Ctr Adv Mat, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Zhou, W; Shao, ZP (corresponding author), Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Shao, ZP (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",zhouwei1982@njtech.edu.cn; shaozp@njtech.edu.cn,"Shao, Zongping/AAY-8177-2020; Yang, Guangming/AAH-4806-2020; Sunarso, Jaka/B-9077-2008; , 周嵬/B-1083-2012","Shao, Zongping/0000-0002-4538-4218; Yang, Guangming/0000-0003-3792-5018; Sunarso, Jaka/0000-0002-5234-7431; , 周嵬/0000-0003-0322-095X",National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21576135]; Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars [BK20170043]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Program for Changjiang ScholarsProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT); Program for Jiangsu Specially-Appointed Professors; Youth Fund in Jiangsu Province [BK20150945],"This work was financially supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 21576135), Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (No. BK20170043), the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, the Program for Changjiang Scholars, the Program for Jiangsu Specially-Appointed Professors, and the Youth Fund in Jiangsu Province (No. BK20150945).",,39,6,6,9,84,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",2196-0216,,,CHEMELECTROCHEM,ChemElectroChem,MAR,2018,5,5,,,,,785,792,,10.1002/celc.201701309,,,8,Electrochemistry,Electrochemistry,FY0IS,WOS:000426495000011,,,,,1/2/2021,

The photocatalytic fuel cell with high and low aeration rate, no aeration and nitrogen purged were investigated, respectively. The degradation rate of diazo dye Reactive Green 19 and the electricity generation was enhanced in photocatalytic fuel cell with higher dissolved oxygen concentration. However, the photocatalytic fuel cell was still able to perform 37% of decolorization in a slow rate (k = 0.033 h(-1)) under extremely low dissolved oxygen concentration (approximately 0.2 mg L-1) when nitrogen gas was introduced into the fuel cell throughout the 8 h. However, the change of the UV Vis spectrum indicates that the intermediates of the dye could not be mineralized under insufficient dissolved oxygen level. In the aspect of electricity generation, the maximum short circuit current (0.0041 mA cm(-2)) and power density (0.00028 mW cm(-2)) of the air purged photocatalytic fuel cell was obviously higher than that with nitrogen purging (0.0015 mA cm(-2) and 0.00008 mW cm(-2)).

From experimental measurements, we found that GO-SPEEK has better proton conductivity (sigma(GO-SPEEK) = 3.8 x 10(-2)S cm(-1)) when compared to Nafion (R) 117 (sigma(Nafion) = 2.4 x 10(-2)S cm(-1)) and SPEEK (sigma(SPEEK) = 2.9 x 10(-3)S cm(-1)). From density functional theory (DFT-) based total energy calculations, we found that GO-SPEEK has the shortest proton diffusion distance among the three membranes, yielding the highest tunneling probability. Hence, GO-SPEEK exhibits the highest conductivity. The short proton diffusion distance in GO-SPEEK, as compared to Nafion (R) 117 and SPEEK, can be attributed to the presence of oxygenated functional groups of GO in the polymer matrix. This also explains why GO-SPEEK requires the lowest hydration level to reach its maximum conductivity. Moreover, we have successfully shown that the proton conductivity sigma is related to the tunneling probability T, i.e., sigma = sigma' exp(-1/T). We conclude that the proton diffusion distance and hydration level are the two most significant factors that determine the membrane's good conductivity. The distance between ionic sites of the membrane should be small to obtain good conductivity. With this short distance, lower hydration level is required. Thus, a membrane with short separation between the ionic sites can have enhanced conductivity, even at low hydration conditions.

The prepared powders with different weight ratios of NiO to BCZY (NiO:BCZY) were denoted as S1 (50:50) and S2 (60:40). The powders were characterized using Thermogravimertic analyzer (TGA), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. TGA results showed that the thermal decomposition of intermediate compounds in the dried powder (T = 150 degrees C) completed at similar to 700 degrees C. XRD analysis confirmed that the calcined powder (T = 1100 degrees C) of S1 and S2 did not show any crystalline peaks related to BCZY compound as the peaks associated to impurity phases of BaCeO3 and BaZrO3 were appeared in their XRD patterns. The impurity phases along with NiO still remained in the S1 sample after it was calcined at 1400 degrees C. As the calcination temperature increased, the particles size of S1 also increased and Zr elemental composition deviates from the nominal stoichiometric of the NiO-BCZY as proven by SEM/EDX analysis. The results indicate that the formation of homogenize NiO-BCZY composite prepared using EDSS method was not favored even after calcined at high temperature (T = 1400 degrees C).","[Samat, Abdullah Abdul; Somalu, Mahendra Rao; Muchtar, Andanastuti] Univ Kebangsaan Malayasia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Senari, Shazana Mohd; Osman, Nafisah] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Sci Appl, Arau 02600, Perlis Indera K, Malaysia; [Muchtar, Andanastuti] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Hassan, Oskar Hasdinor] Univ Teknol MARX, Fac Art & Design, Dept Ind Ceram, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor Darul, Malaysia","Osman, N (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Sci Appl, Arau 02600, Perlis Indera K, Malaysia.",fisha@perlis.uitm.edu.my,"Samat, Abdullah Abdul/F-2544-2018; Hassan, Oskar Hasdinor/G-2982-2019","Samat, Abdullah Abdul/0000-0002-9407-6684; Hassan, Oskar Hasdinor/0000-0002-2898-7148; Somalu, Mahendra Rao/0000-0003-1667-693X; MOHD ISA @ OSMAN, PROFESOR MADYA DR NAFISAH/0000-0002-6303-8554","Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia [600-IRMI/TRGS 5/3 (1/2016)-2]; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia [GUP-2015-038, DIP-2016-005]; Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP); MOHEMinistry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia for the Transdisciplinary Research Grant Scheme (600-IRMI/TRGS 5/3 (1/2016)-2) and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia for the Geran Universiti Penyelidikan (GUP-2015-038 and DIP-2016-005).

The coculture showed around 3 times higher current density in MFCs compared with either of these two bacteria alone. Metabolite analysis demonstrated that the fermentative metabolite (1,3-propanediol) produced by K variicola stimulated the P. aeruginosa to produce a higher amount of pyocyanin through synergistic interactions, leading to the enhancement in the performance of coculture MFCs fed with palm oil mill effluent (POME).

Surface porosity and micro hardness were analyzed. The relationship of the structural properties with the electrical and electrochemical performances of the SrFe0.5Ti0.5O3-delta film was examined. The high densification of the film sintered at 1300 degrees C led to the better electrical conductivity of 16.38 S cm(-1) than the 4.86 S cm(-1) of the film sintered at 900 degrees C at an operating temperature of 800 degrees C.

The effects of calcination time and temperature on the particle size and the physiochemical properties of nanocrystalline NiO-GDC are presented in this paper. Using this method, gel beads were formed by contacting sodium alginate solution as the gelling template and metal (gadolinium/cerium/Ni) nitrates as the precursor. The obtained nanocrystallites were characterized using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, thermo gravimetric analysis, nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. It was observed that the increasing calcination temperature had affected both the particle size and the surface area of the NiO-GDC, whereas the increasing calcination time had only impacted the size of the particles. The smallest mesoporous nanocrystalline NiO-GDC powder (12.1225 +/- 0.005 m(2)/g surface area), composed of cubic GDC (5.18 nm crystallite size) and cubic NiO (7.99 nm crystallite size) were synthesized at a calcination temperature of 500 degrees C for 2 h.

LSCF nanoceramic powders were synthesized by an activated carbon-assisted sot gel process using metal nitrate-based chemicals. The LSCF powder was transformed to a slurry and spin-coated onto both surfaces of BCZY pellet to form a symmetrical cell with the configuration of LSCF/BCZY/LSCF. The symmetrical cell was subsequently sintered at 950 degrees C for 2 h to allow a good contact formation between electrode/electrolyte layers. The phase structural verification of the calcined powders was investigated by X-Ray diffractometer (XRD). Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was employed to examine the morphology of the sintered cell.

The physico-chemical characteristics (methanol permeability, water uptake and proton conductivity) of the membranes are observed. Thermal stability of all membranes is observed using Thermal Gravimetry Analysis (TGA). The thrree stages of degradation range between 163.1 and 613.1 degrees C. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is used to study the wettability of the membranes. SP/e-spunCL15 shows the lowest freezing bound water of 15.27%, which contributed to the lowest methanol permeability. The non-freezing bound water that proportionally increased with proton conductivity of SP/e-spunCL15 membrane is the highest, 10.60%. It is suggested that the electrospinning as the fabricating method has successfully exfoliated the Cloisite in the membrane surface structure, contributing to the decrease of methanol permeability, while the retained water has led to the enhancement of proton conductivity. This new fabrication method of SP/e-spunCL membrane is said to be a desirable polymer electrolyte membrane for future application in direct methanol fuel cell field.","[Awang, Nuha; Jaafar, Juhana; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Skudai 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia; [Awang, Nuha; Jaafar, Juhana; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Chem & Energy Engn, Skudai 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia","Jaafar, J; Ismail, AF (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Skudai 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.; Jaafar, J; Ismail, AF (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Chem & Energy Engn, Skudai 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.",nuhaawang@yahoo.com; juhana@petroleum.utm.my; afauzi@utm.my,"Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi/D-2643-2012; Awang, Nuha/AAV-3541-2020","Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi/0000-0003-0150-625X; ","Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE)Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR) [R.J130000.4F157, Q.J130000.2509.05H52, Q.J130000.21A2.03E57]; Research Management Centre (RMC); Zamalah scholarship - School of Graduate Study (SPS) UTM","The author (Nuha Awang) is thankful to the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) for FRGS grants R.J130000.4F157, Q.J130000.2509.05H52, and Q.J130000.21A2.03E57 for the financial support; the Research Management Centre (RMC); UTM for research management activities; and Zamalah scholarship provided by School of Graduate Study (SPS) UTM.",,40,10,10,2,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4360,,,POLYMERS-BASEL,Polymers,FEB,2018,10,2,,,,,,,194,10.3390/polym10020194,,,16,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,FZ4EB,WOS:000427542900089,30966230,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,1/2/2021,

The incorporation of uncertainties in the operational parameters during the optimization process is very important to ensure that the fuel cell can operate reliably in reallife deployment. Unfortunately, no attention has been given thus far on studying the effects of parameter uncertainties on the fuel cell performance. In this paper, the output power and hydrogen flow rate are being optimized under uncertain conditions of the stack current, stack temperature, oxygen excess ratio, hydrogen excess ratio and inlet air humidity of the PEM fuel cell. The effective application of a new analytical moment-based uncertainty evaluation technique proposed in combination with response surface methodology provides an accurate and numerically efficient evaluation of the fuel cell performance. The paper has demonstrated that the optimal mean output power under uncertainty is 1329.56 W and its corresponding operating point is different from that of the optimal output power 1545.25 W calculated assuming all parameters are fixed. The results show that, for the selected PEM fuel cell model, meeting probabilistic constraints makes the fuel cell less susceptible to input variations, but this can only be achieved at the expense of optimal output power. The useful framework, analyses and discussions presented in the paper can be adapted into any fuel cell performance evaluation and design optimization. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The NPs of NiO and CoO were prepared using hydrothermal method and were further applied to analyse, their effect on hydrogen production. The results demonstrated that, a maxima volumetric hydrogen production rate of 21 ml H-2/L-POME/h with the hydrogen yield of 0.563 L H-2/g-CODremoved was obtained with 1.5 mg/L concentration of NiO NPs. On the other hand, the addition of CoO NPs produced maximum volumetric hydrogen production rate of 18 ml H-2/L-POME/h with a hydrogen yield of 0.487 L H-2/g-CODremoved with 1.0 mg/L of CoO NPs. Results showed that addition of optimal concentration of NiO and CoO NPs to the POME enhances the hydrogen yield by 1.51 and 1.67 fold respectively. Besides, this addition of NiO and CoO enhanced the COD removal efficiency by 15 and 10% respectively as compared to an un-additive NPs POME. The toxicity of NPs was also tested using bacterial viability test, which revealed that application of 3.0 mg/L of NiO and CoO NPs to modified Luria-Bertani (LB) medium had 63% and 83% reduction in bacterial cell growth. The results concluded that supplementation of NiO and CoO NPs under an optimal range to the wastewater can improve the hydrogen productivity.

The present study is to investigate the possibility of the use of electron shuttle producing bacteria Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia) to boost up the performance of yeast Lipomyces starkeyi (L. starkeyi) driven MFC. The MFCs inoculated with L. starkeyi and K. pneumoniae coculture achieved a maximum power density of 12.87 W/m(3) which is about 3 and 6 times higher than that of MFC solely inoculated with pure yeast and bacteria, respectively, demonstrating that the yeast cells have successfully utilized the reduced electron shuttles excreted by the bacteria. The occurrence of the mutualistic interactions was further supported by the CV and EIS results.

A moderately dilute solution (50%) of POME showed higher microbial growth and lipid accumulation and offered a significantly higher degree of bioremediation. A lipid content of 21.32% was achieved with 50% POME, whereas the value was 15.14% for 25% POME. Three different techniques including ultrasonic treatment, Fenton's reagent and Fenton's + ultrasonic were employed to extract lipids from microbial biomass, and the maximum lipid concentration was obtained using the Fenton's + ultrasonic treatment. The degree of bioremediation was evaluated by the calculating seed germination index (GI) values. Higher GI values were observed for the 25% and 50% dilutions compared to undiluted (100%) POME. This combined approach can be a potential alternative technology that integrates bioremediation of POME with microbial lipid production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Islam, M.

Yet, there is lack of detailed studies on understanding how multiple wild microorganisms could alter bioelectrochemical reactions in MFC for degrading toxic organic contaminants and generating electricity from industrial wastewater. Hence, this study evaluates the microbial community and bioelectrochemical activities in a lab-scale MFC reactor inoculated by petrochemical industrial microbial consortium (IMC) and domestic microbial consortium (DMC), aiming to enhance MFC performance for degrading 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) and producing electricity. Cutting-edge microbiology analysis techniques were used for identifying microbial community in suspension and biofilm in the IMC and DMC inoculated MFC systems. Research focused on evaluating how the variable microbial population and 2,4-DCP feeding could affect bioelectrochemical activities and MFC performance. Arcobacter, Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Cloacibacterium, and Shewanella sp. in DMC were found to be important bacteria for 2,4-DCP degradation while Bacillus sp. dominated IMC contributing to higher electricity production. This would be the first discovery of Cloacibacterium sp. contributing phenol degradation in MFC. IMC-MFC reactor performed well in producing high 156 mA/m(2) current density with 41% phenolic degradation, while DMC-MFC showed promising 62% 2,4-DCP reduction and 123 mA/m(2) current production. MFC systems performed highly comparable 2,4-DCP degradation efficiency than the conventional anaerobic biodegradation. These results demonstrate that wastewater-inoculated MFCs can be capable of simultaneous energy generation and phenolic degradation and provide new insights that may assist with future MFC optimisation.","[Hassan, Huzairy; Jin, Bo; Dai, Sheng] Univ Adelaide, Sch Chem Engn, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Hassan, Huzairy] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Bioproc Engn, Kompleks Pusat Pengajian Jejawi 3, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia; [Donner, Erica; Vasileiadis, Sotirios; Saint, Christopher] Univ South Australia, Future Ind Inst, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia","Jin, B; Dai, S (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Chem Engn, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",bo.jin@adelaide.edu.au; s.dai@adelaide.edu.au,"Dai, Sheng/H-5951-2018; Vasileiadis, Sotirios/G-4119-2014; Dai, Sheng/F-8858-2014; Donner, Erica/A-4809-2012","Dai, Sheng/0000-0002-9152-0786; Vasileiadis, Sotirios/0000-0002-2048-8192; Dai, Sheng/0000-0002-9152-0786; Donner, Erica/0000-0001-6465-2233",,,,67,47,47,16,314,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",1385-8947,1873-3212,,CHEM ENG J,Chem.

In this work, we report the preparation of an A-site deficient Zr-doped proton conductor composition of Ba0.95Ce0.85Tb0.05Zr0.1O3-delta (BCTZ) in the dual-layer hollow fiber configuration consisting of Ni-BCTZ inner porous layer and BCTZ outer dense layer, denoted as BCTZ/Ni-BCTZ hollow fiber via co-spinning, co-sintering, and reduction (in hydrogen) processes. The presence of Zr(4+)in BCTZ perovskite lattice leads to higher CO2 resistance for BCTZ relative to Ba0.95Ce0.95Tb0.05O3-delta (BCT) as revealed by their CO2-temperature programmed desorption results. H-2 permeation flux of dual-layer BCTZ/Ni-BCTZ hollow fiber reaches a maximum of 0.41 mL min (-1) cm (-2) at 900 degrees C. When CO2 was introduced in the permeate side, H (2)permeation flux was enhanced with respect to the CO2-absent case, which is attributed to the presence of reverse water-gas shift reaction that consumes the permeated H-2 to produce carbon monoxide and water. The dual-layer BCTZ/Ni-BCTZ hollow fiber showed stable H-2 permeation fluxes when operated at 800 degrees C in CO2-containing permeate atmosphere for 25 days. Its original morphology and structure were retained following this long term operational test; highlighting its potential use for H-2 separation in CO2-containing reactions and processes.","[Shang, Yingying; Wei, Luyang; Meng, Xiuxia; Meng, Bo; Yang, Naitao] Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Chem Engn, Zibo 255049, Peoples R China; [Sunarso, Jaka] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Jalan Simpang Tiga, Kuching 93350, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Liu, Shaomin] Curtin Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Perth, WA 6102, Australia","Meng, XX (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Chem Engn, Zibo 255049, Peoples R China.; Sunarso, J (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Jalan Simpang Tiga, Kuching 93350, Sarawak, Malaysia.",mengxiux@126.com; jsunarso@swinburne.edu.my,"Sunarso, Jaka/B-9077-2008; Liu, shaomin/E-3669-2010","Sunarso, Jaka/0000-0002-5234-7431; Liu, shaomin/0000-0001-5019-5182","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21376143, 21476131]; Primary Research and Development Plan of Shandong Province [2016GGX104007]; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (RFDP)Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (RFDP)Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP) [20131201110007]; Swinburne Sarawak Research Grant (SSRG) [2-5534]","The authors gratefully acknowledge the research funding provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, No. 21376143 and 21476131), Primary Research and Development Plan of Shandong Province (2016GGX104007), and the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (RFDP 20131201110007).

The synthesized Co/Mn-doped Pd alloys can inhibit Pd agglomeration that hinders Pd use as an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) promoter on solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode. The presence of Co or Mn on Pd lattice of Co/Mn-doped Pd alloy-decorated YSZ (Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2) cathode provides dual advantages of improving the ORR performance of the cathode and enhancing the ORR performance stability during long term operation. Between 600 degrees C and 800 degrees C, Pd0.90Co0.10O-impregnated YSZ cathode displayed the highest ORR performance among PdO-, Pd0.90Co0.10O-, Pd0.75Co0.025O-, Pd0.90Mn0.10O-, and Pd0.75Mn0.25O-impregnated cathodes as indicated by its relatively low area specific resistance of 0.14 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Our thermal gravimetric analyses and scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the high electrochemical performance stability of Co/Mn-doped Pd alloys during 30 hour cathodic current test correlates with their higher metal <-> metal oxide conversion reversibility and microstructure stability under thermal cycling between room temperature and 900 degrees C (relative to Pd).

The Fe3O4 was synthesized in the absence of an inert environment and organic solvent, using a modified coprecipitation procedure. Fe3O4 nanoparticles of average size 15 nm served as the best catalyst support for Co3O4, in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A current density of 10 mA/cm(2) was achieved, at -0.36 and 1.64 V for the HER and OER [versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)], respectively, for the Co3O4/Fe3O4 system, in 0.1 M KOH with low total catalyst loading of 250 mu g/cm(2) (or 100 mu g(Co3O4)/cm(2)). Compared to those using the same total loading of unsupported Co3O4 catalyst, the overpotentials of Co3O4/Fe3O4 catalyst decreased by 0.22 and 0.06 V for the HER and OER, respectively. Despite low nonprecious metal loading, the Co3O4/Fe3O4 system showed high OER kinetics with low Tafel slope of 63 mV/dec. Chronoamperometry tests performed, at 1.62 and -0.30 V for the OER and HER, respectively, on the Co3O4/Fe3O4 catalyst demonstrated extremely stable OER over a period of 8 h. FESEM images of Co3O4/Fe3O4 revealed that the Co3O4 platelets were self-assembled into edge-on orientation on the Fe3O4 support. This largely accounted for the high catalytic activities observed because of the large total exposed surface area of Co3O4/Fe3O4 for catalytic reactions, in addition to electrochemical and morphological effects. Despite negating the need for specially tailored morphologies, Co3O4/Fe3O4 demonstrated enhanced electrochemical performance and stability. This may serve as a cost-effective route to the large-scale commercialization of electrolyzers and fuel cells via facile synthesis of nonprecious metal oxides as the catalyst support system for enhanced electrochemical water electrolysis.","[Ng, Kai-Ling; Ong, Boon-Hoong] Univ Malaya, Inst Grad Studies, Nanotechnol & Catalysis Res Ctr, Level 3,Block A, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Kok, Kuan-Ying] Agensi Nuklear Malaysia, Kajang 43000, Selangor Darul, Malaysia","Ong, BH (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Inst Grad Studies, Nanotechnol & Catalysis Res Ctr, Level 3,Block A, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",bhong@um.edu.my,"Ong, Boon Hoong/A-7319-2010","Ong, Boon Hoong/0000-0001-8126-2376",University of Malaya RU Grant [RU018E-2016],This work was supported by University of Malaya RU Grant (RU018E-2016).,,46,13,13,11,19,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2574-0970,,,ACS APPL NANO MATER,ACS Appl.

Subsequently, the pre-calcined powders were then used to fabricate composite pellets using a uniaxial press and sintered at a low temperature of 600 degrees C. The crystalline phase, carbonate bonding, microstructure and thermal behaviour of the composite anode powders were investigated. The microstructure, porosity, and hardness of sintered composite pellets were also evaluated. All samples maintained their chemical compatibility and carbonate bonding after various processes. The findings indicated that the pre-calcination factor was more important than NiO loading in terms of powder and pellet morphologies as well as the thermal expansion behaviour. Moreover, the composite pellets prepared with composite powders pre-calcined at increasing temperatures exhibited an increase in porosity, but within an acceptable range (30 - 40 %).

In this study, performance of structured montmorillonite (MMT) dispersed Fe-doped titanium dioxide (Fe/TiO2) nanocomposite was tested for dynamic photo induced CO2 reduction by H-2 to fuels. Cordierite monolithic support was employed in order to improve the photo-activity and reusability of Fe-MMT/TiO2 nanocomposite in a CO2 utilization process. MMT-clay supported Fe/TiO2 samples were prepared by a controlled and direct sol-gel method and were dip-coated over the monolith micro-channels. The efficiency of Fe-loaded MMT/TiO2 for CO2 reduction by H-2 toward CO was investigated using a cell type and a monolith photo-reactor under UV-light. The maximum CO yield over 3 wt % Fe-10 wt % MMT-loaded TiO2 catalyst reached 166 mole g-catal.(-1)h(-1) at selectivity 99.70%, considerably higher than the amount of CO produced over the MMT/TiO2 (16 mu mole g-catal.(-1) h(-1)) and the pure TiO2 (5 mole g-catal.(-1) h(-1)) catalysts. The other products observed with adequate amounts were CH4 and C2H6. More importantly, photo-activity and stability of Fe-MMT/TiO2 catalyst for CO evolution was significantly improved using monolith photo-reactor compared to the cell type reactor under the same operating conditions. This enactment was evidently due to higher quantum efficiency of monolith photoreactor, improved adsorption-desorption process in a catalyst coated monolith channels and hindered charges recombination by Fe. The reusability of catalyst loaded over the monolithic support showed greater recycling capability than the catalyst dispersed in a cell reactor. This development confirmed higher photo-activity of Fe-MMT/TiO2 photo-catalyst loaded over monolithic support for CO2 photo-reduction to cleaner fuels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The as-prepared powder was characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, and high-resolution electron microscopy techniques. A terpineol-based ink vehicle was used to prepare the LSCF cathode ink for screen printing. The effects of thickness, LSCF solid content, and sintering temperature on morphological and electrochemical characteristics were systematically investigated using scanning electron microscopy and impedance spectroscopy. The thickness, solid content, and sintering temperature are essential in determining the polarization resistance of mixed ionic electronic conducting (MIEC) LSCF cathode material.

ZnO nanoparticles decorated with an imine-linked receptor have been used in the fabrication of a photocathode based on dye-sensitized solar cells for the purpose of photovoltaic efficiency enhancement. Various characterization techniques have been employed to investigate the structural, morphological, and optical behaviors of the solar cell having ZnO nanoparticles and ZnO nanoparticles decorated with an organic ligand as a photocathode layer. The decorated nanoparticles have a stable wurtzite structure and an average grain size of similar to 45 nm, confirmed by the TEM image and XRD through the Scherrer equation. The ZnO sample emits wide peaks in the visible range, and the emission intensity of the ZnO-DOL sample increases along with a red-shift (0.38 eV) in the band gap. This shift can be explained using deep level transition, surface plasmon energy of a surfactant, and coupling of ZnO with local surface plasmon energy. UV-vis absorption spectra together with photoluminescence spectra confirm the higher absorption rate due to organic ligand decoration on ZnO nanoparticles. The greatest solar power-to-electricity conversion efficiency (h) of 3.48% is achieved for the ZnO-DOL sample. It is enhanced by 3.13% as compared to that of the ZnO-based solar cell. The ZnO-DOL device exhibits a higher external quantum efficiency (EQE), responsivity (R-lambda), and photocurrent-to-dark current ratio; this confirms the improvement in the solar cell performance.","[Samavati, Alireza; Samavati, Zahra; Ismail, A.

Single-phase, sub-micron LSC powder was used to prepare cathode slurries by a simple grinding-stirring (G-S) technique and an advanced ball milling-triple roll milling (BM-TRM) technique. The prepared G-S and BM-TRM cathode slurries were brush painted and screen printed, respectively, onto separate BaCe0.54Zr0.36Y0.1O2.95 (BCZY)proton-conducting electrolytes to fabricate symmetrical cells of LSC\BCZY\LSC. The thickness of LSC cathode layer prepared by brush painting and screen printing was 17 +/- 0.5 mu m and 7 +/- 0.5 mu m, and the surface porosity of the layers was 32% and 27%, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed that the layer deposited by screen printing had lower area specific resistance measured at 700 degrees C (0.12 Omega cm(2)) than the layer prepared by brush painting of G-S slurry (1.50 Omega cm(2)). The enhanced LSC cathode-performance of the cell fabricated using BM-TRM assisted with screen printing is attributed to the improved particle homogeneity and network in the prepared slurry and the enhanced particle connectivity in the screen printed film.","[Samat, Abdullah Abdul; Yusoff, Wan Nor Anasuhah Wan; Baharuddin, Nurul Akidah; Somalu, Mahendra Rao; Muchtar, Andanastuti] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Muchtar, Andanastuti] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ctr Mat Engn & Smart Mfg MERCU, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Osman, Nafisah] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Appl Sci, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia","Somalu, MR (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",mahen@ukm.edu.my,"Baharuddin, Nurul Akidah/G-2729-2017; Samat, Abdullah Abdul/F-2544-2018","Baharuddin, Nurul Akidah/0000-0003-1604-8749; Samat, Abdullah Abdul/0000-0002-9407-6684",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) [DIP-2016-005]; Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) of Malaysia [600-IRMI/TRGS 5/3 (1/2016)-2]; MOHEMinistry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR); Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP),"The authors would like to acknowledge the Research University Grant (DIP-2016-005) provided by the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) and the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) of Malaysia for the financial support provided via the Transdisciplinary Research Grant Scheme (600-IRMI/TRGS 5/3 (1/2016)-2).

Characterization such as FESEM, XRD, Hall effect and Cyclic Voltammetry were employed to investigate the morphological, structural, electrical and electrochemical properties of the as-sputtered as well as annealed samples. Initial results showed that the films obtained by increasing the substrate temperature during sputtering are smoother and have better adhesion to the etched silicon substrates. It has also been observed that the rate of deposition increases resulting in thicker films for longer deposition time at higher temperature. Upon annealing, Ta2O5 films achieved better crystallinity consisting of orthorhombic phases. The average thicknesses of the films are in the range of 400 nm-700 nm.

The efficiency of aerated sediment microbial fuel cells (A-SMFCs) and non-aerated sediment microbial fuel cells (NA-SMFCs) was studied. The A-SMFCs generated a voltage of 580.5 mV between 50 and 60 days, while NA-SMFCs produced a voltage of 510 mV between 60 and 80 days. The cell design point for A-SMFCs was 2 k, while for NA-SMFCs it was 200 . In both SMFCs, the maximum current values relating to forward scanning, reverse scanning and oxidation/reduction peaks were recorded on the 80(th) day. The anode showed maximum additional capacitance on the 80(th) day (A-SMFC: 2.7 F cm(-2); and NA-SMFC: 2.2 F cm(-2)). The whole cell electrochemical impedance using the Nyquist model was 21 for A-SMFCs and 15 for NA-SMFCs. After glucose enrichment, the impedance of A-SMFCs was 24.3 and 14.6 for NA-SMFCs. After 60 days, the A-SMFCs reduced the maximum amount of Cr(vi) to Cr(iii) ions (80.70%) and Cu(ii) to Cu(i) ions (72.72%), and showed maximum intracellular uptake of Ni(ii) ions (80.37%); the optimum remediation efficiency of NA-SMFCs was after 80 days toward Cr(vi) ions (67.36%), Cu(ii) ions (59.36%) and Ni(ii) ions (52.74%). Both SMFCs showed highest heavy metal reduction and power generation at a pH of 7.0. SEM images and 16S rRNA gene analysis showed a diverse bacterial community in both A-SMFCs and NA-SMFCs. The performance of A-SMFCs showed that they could be exercised as durable and efficient technology for power production and the detoxification of heavy metal sediments. The NA-SMFCs could also be employed where anaerobic fermentation is required.","[Abbas, Syed Zaghum; Rafatullah, Mohd; Ismail, Norli] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Ind Technol, Div Environm Technol, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Shakoori, Farah R.] Univ Punjab, Dept Zool, New Campus, Lahore, Pakistan","Rafatullah, M (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Ind Technol, Div Environm Technol, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",mohd_rafatullah@yahoo.co.in,"Ismail, Norli/F-8065-2010; Rafatullah, Mohd/C-8191-2009","Ismail, Norli/0000-0001-7941-7412; Rafatullah, Mohd/0000-0002-4590-3153; Abbas, Syed Zaghum/0000-0002-4633-5944",Universiti Sains Malaysia Global Fellowship (USMGF); RUI grant [1001/PTEKIND/8011044],The authors would like to express their appreciation to the Universiti Sains Malaysia Global Fellowship (USMGF) and RUI grant (1001/PTEKIND/8011044) for the support and research facilities for this project.,,38,17,17,1,40,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2046-2069,,,RSC ADV,RSC Adv.,,2018,8,34,,,,,18800,18813,,10.1039/c8ra01711e,,,14,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry,GH4RK,WOS:000433391600008,,DOAJ Gold,,,1/2/2021,

The investigation of mechanical characteristics of hydrogen stored SWCNT is critical in determining the lifetime and stability of SWCNT-based membranes used in PEMFC. The study provides a comprehensive analysis on the effects of geometry, vacancy defects and PEMFC operating temperature on the mechanical properties of hydrogen stored SWCNT. The findings show that the mechanical strength of the hydrogen stored SWCNT can be enhanced by deploying a bigger armchair SWCNT. Furthermore, increase in operating temperature of PEMFC reduces the mechanical resistance of hydrogen stored SWCNT, which however can be overcome by suitably introducing vacancy defects in the SWCNT geometry. This has provided potential way of increasing the hydrogen storage capacity of SWCNT which is very useful for onboard application of PEMFC. It is anticipated that the findings obtained from this paper will have a paramount importance in the field of hydrogen energy fuel cell technology and further compliment the potential applications of SWCNTs as promising candidates for applications in fuel cells and energy storage devices.","[Vijayaraghavan, V.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Mech & Mfg Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Vijayaraghavan, V.; Dethan, Jacob F.

Two new kinds of cathode electrodes were evaluated: (i) mixed carbon black-activated carbon electrodes and (ii) mixed carbon black-diamond electrodes. These electrodes were compared with a conventional platinum electrode. With a reaction temperature of 80 degrees C, an electric current of 2.0 A, and ambient pressure, the mixed carbon black-activated carbon electrode demonstrated excellent performance and successfully reduced glycerol to 1,2-propanediol with a high selectivity of 86% and 74% glycerol conversion. The selectivity of 1,2-propanediol on the mixed carbon black-diamond electrode and the platinum electrode was 68% and 61%, respectively, with 88% glycerol conversion on the mixed carbon black-diamond electrode and 67% glycerol conversion on the platinum electrode.

The performance and ionic gradient concentration of MFCs using CMs were compared with that of cation exchange membrane (CEM), Nafion 117. MFC with CMs exhibited a higher performance than that of CEM under batch operation. The highest power density of 1790 +/- 60 mW/m(2), columbic efficiency (CE) of 41 +/- 10% and internal resistance of 102 +/- 13 U were obtained for MFC with CM3 under batch mode operation. The highest power density, columbic efficiency and internal resistance of MFC with CEM were found to be 1225 +/- 20 mW/m(2), 21 +/- 1% and 400 +/- 10 U, respectively. The highest performance of MFC with CM3 was expected due to a higher porosity of CM3 (13.8%) compared with that of CM1 (11.0%) and CM2 (11.05%). MFCs operated with catholyte containing salt solution, phosphate buffer basal medium without carbon source and yeast extract (PBBM-SA), generated lower current than with phosphate buffer (PB) as catholyte. This difference was more significant in the MFCs with the CEM Nafion 117 than with ceramic membranes. The nonselective porous ceramic membranes improved the diffusion of protons in the presence of other high concentration cations and resulted in MFC with higher performance. Hence, the porous ceramic membrane is a potential candidate separator for the development of commercial scale MFCs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The distance between the tip and the collector (DTC) and the flow rate were examined as influencing parameters in the electrospinning technique. To ensure that the best catalytic material is fabricated, the nanofiber underwent several characterizations and electrochemical tests, including FTIR, XRD, FESEM, TEM, and cyclic voltammetry. The results show that D18, fabricated with a flow rate of 0.1 mLhr(-1) and DTC of 18 cm, is an ultrafine nanofiber with the smallest average diameter, 136.73 +/- 39.56 nm.

The highest COD removal efficiency was observed in mesophilic condition (45 degrees C). It was observed that the bioreactors operated at 45 degrees C had the highest filtration resistance compared to others, albeit the excellent performance in removing the organic pollutant. Next, MFC was combined with AnMBR where the MFC acted as a pre-treatment unit prior to AnMBR and it was fed directly with palm oil mill effluent (POME). The supernatant from MFC was further treated by AnMBR. Noticeable improvement in filtration performance was observed in the combined system. Decrease in polysaccharide amount was observed in combined system which in turn suggested that the better filtration performance.","[Tan, Sze Pin; Kong, Hong Feng; Bashir, Mohammed J.

The reaction conditions are critical issues affecting the glycerol electro-oxidation performance. This study presents the effects of catalyst loading, temperature, and electrolyte concentration. The glycerol oxidation performance of the PdAu/VGCNF catalyst on the anode side is tested via cyclic voltammetry with a 3 mm(2) active area. The morphology and physical properties of the catalyst are examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Then, optimization is carried out using the response surface method with central composite experimental design. The current density is experimentally obtained as a response variable from a set of experimental laboratory tests. The catalyst loading, temperature, and NaOH concentration are taken as independent parameters, which were evaluated previously in the screening experiments. The highest current density of 158.34 mAcm(-2) is obtained under the optimal conditions of 3.0 M NaOH concentration, 60 degrees C temperature and 12 wt.% catalyst loading.

On this application, the dynamic performance of the PEM fuel cell is crucial in ensuring smooth operation of the vehicle. The PEM fuel cell stack should be maintained at its optimum performance while being responsive during real road driving condition which is best represented by legislative driving cycle. The present study is conducted to evaluate the performance of a PEM fuel cell stack for vehicle application subjected to New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) by utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The studied PEM fuel cell stack comprises 320 cells with 1600 cm(2) active catalyst area. The effect of variable inlet following NEDC profile on the PEM fuel cell performance is investigated as well. Several possible scenarios, i.e. steady inlet flows, variable inlet flows at anode, cathode, coolant and combinations of these, are examined and discussed in the light of numerical result. The results reveal that variable inlet flows have considerable effect on the total net power generated, thermal envelope and liquid saturation albeit its marginal effects on the stack performance in term of stack power.","[Kurnia, Jundika C.] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Mech Engn, Bandar Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak Darul Rid, Malaysia; [Sasmito, Agus P.] McGill Univ, Dept Min & Mat Engn, Univ 3450, Frank Dawson Adams Bldg, Montreal, PQ H3A 0E8, Canada; [Shamim, Tariq] Masdar Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Sasmito, AP (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Min & Mat Engn, Univ 3450, Frank Dawson Adams Bldg, Montreal, PQ H3A 0E8, Canada.",jundika.kurnia@utp.edu.my; agus.sasmito@mcgill.ca,"Sasmito, Agus P/A-5732-2011; Sasmito, Agus P./S-9439-2019","Sasmito, Agus P/0000-0003-3444-8922; Sasmito, Agus P./0000-0003-3444-8922; Kurnia, Jundika Candra/0000-0003-1334-6484",CFI-JELF,Computations were performed at McGill HPC under Calcul-Quebec and Compute-Canada with support from CFI-JELF.,,24,18,18,3,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

For a real application, the effect of CO2 impurity in the H-2 fuel (i.e., the gas output from separation techniques) toward the PEM fuel cell performance was studied. Hence, a novel synthesized membrane made of glassy polymers, polyetherimide (PEI) coated bio-cellulose nanofibers and a coconut shell activated carbon (CAC) as adsorbents carriers were used. For the membrane separation technique, the bio-cellulose nanofiber is coated with PEI at varying concentration from 3 to 15 wt.%. The effect of PEI concentrations on the gas permeability and selectivity were observed. Meanwhile, for the adsorption separation technique, the performance of activated carbon was tested by using 0.6 L single column adsorber unit. The characterization of both developed membrane and adsorbent were analyzed including their morphologies and the physical properties. From the results, at 3 wt.% PEI coating, the CO2 permeability was 16.72 Barrer and corresponding selectivity of CO2/H-2 was 0.15. Moreover, the adsorbents carriers showed a better adsorption capacity for CO2 removal at which 77.17 mg of CO2/g of adsorbent in a lower flow rate of feed gas at 0.5 L/min. In the case of PEM fuel cell, the performance would decrease with the increase of CO2 impurity in H-2. Therefore, the results presented on this paper are the initial findings generated for the biohydrogen separation technology for the future portable power of PEM fuel cell application.

It is nearly impossible for a photovoltaic (PV) system to supply power continuously and consistently to a varying load. Operating a controllable source like a fuel cell in parallel with PV can be a solution to supply power to variable loads. In order to coordinate the power supply from fuel cells and PVs, a power management system needs to be designed for the microgrid system. This paper presents a power management system for a grid-connected PV and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), considering variation in the load and solar radiation. The objective of the proposed system is to minimize the power drawn from the grid and operate the SOFC within a specific power range. Since the PV is operated at the maximum power point, the power management involves the control of SOFC active power where a proportional and integral (PI) controller is used. The control parameters of the PI controller Kp (proportional constant) and Ti (integral time constant) are determined by the genetic algorithm (GA) and simplex method. In addition, a fuzzy logic controller is also developed to generate appropriate control parameters for the PI controller. The performance of the controllers is evaluated by minimizing the integral of time multiplied by absolute error (ITAE) criterion. Simulation results showed that the fuzzy-based PI controller outperforms the PI controller tuned by the GA and simplex method in managing the power from the hybrid source effectively under variations of load and solar radiation.","[Sukumar, Shivashankar; Marsadek, Marayati] Univ Tenaga Nas, IPE, Selangor 43000, Malaysia; [Ramasamy, Agileswari] Univ Tenaga Nas, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Selangor 43000, Malaysia; [Mokhlis, Hazlie] Univ Malaya, Dept Elect Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Mekhilef, Saad] Univ Malaya, Power Elect & Renewable Energy Res Lab PEARL, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Sukumar, S (corresponding author), Univ Tenaga Nas, IPE, Selangor 43000, Malaysia.",shiva.power1985@gmail.com; Marayati@uniten.edu.my; agileswari@uniten.edu.my; hazli@um.edu.my; saad@um.edu.my,"Saad, Mekhilef/B-9652-2010; Mokhlis, Hazlie/B-8616-2010; Abu Bakar, Halim/B-8085-2010","Saad, Mekhilef/0000-0001-8544-8995; Mokhlis, Hazlie/0000-0002-1166-1934; Marsadek, Marayati/0000-0002-7294-4487",Ministry of Education Malaysia [HIR-MOHED000004-16001],This work was supported by the Ministry of Education Malaysia (HIR-MOHED000004-16001).,,29,7,7,0,7,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1996-1073,,,ENERGIES,Energies,NOV,2017,10,11,,,,,,,1720,10.3390/en10111720,,,17,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,FO7IG,WOS:000417046500039,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Accepted",,,1/2/2021,

There was no significant difference in the chemical oxygen demand reduction when system operated in either open or closed circuit. This study clearly showed that higher nitrate reduction efficiency obtained in closed circuit (74.7 +/- 7.0%) due to bio-electrochemical denitrification compared to only 41.7% in the open circuit.

The A- and NA-SMFC open-circuit voltages were respectively about 665 and 275mV, with quite steady performances for 120days. The cell design points of both SMFCs were calculated by implementing polarization curves, and they were at 1k (power density 8.1mW/m(2) and current density 0.0504mA/m(2) with voltage 150mV) for NA-SMFC and 100 (power density 252.81mW/m(2) and current density 0.954mA/m(2) with voltage of 275mV) for A-SMFC, respectively. Cathode potentials were at 30k 290mV (NA-SMFC) and 500mV (A-SMFC). As to the anode, at 30K, it was -180mV (NA-SMFC) and 190mV (A-SMFC). The voltammetry profiles of A-SMFC showed maximum current (forward scan, 22.7A; reverse scan, -19.4A) followed by NA-SMFC (forward scan, 11.3A; reverse scan, -9.5A). The cell design points of A-SMFC and NA-SMFC were altered after pH and temperature amendments at 200 and 700, respectively. As to metal removal rate, the maximum arsenic cadmium and lead removal was observed in A-SMFC at pH 7.0 (77.70%, 90.86%, and 83.91%) and 45 degrees C (66.22%, 79.03%, and 71.17%). Scanning electron microscopy confirmed, at pH 7.0 and 45 degrees C, an optimal biofilm growth at cathode and anode graphite of both SMFCs. After 120days of operation, genomic DNA was extracted from biofilms and analyzed for rDNA 16S sequences. Similarity search was performed by using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool algorithm against the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gen Bank showing Pseudomonas spp. dominance at both anode and cathode. The results revealed that the A-SMFC system could be employed as an effective and long-term tool for power generation as well as stimulated bioremediation of the polluted sediments.","[Abbas, Syed Zaghum; Rafatullah, Mohd; Ismail, Norli] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Ind Technol, Div Environm Technol, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Nastro, Rosa Anna] Parthenope Univ Naples, Dept Engn, Naples, Italy","Rafatullah, M (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Ind Technol, Div Environm Technol, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",mohd_rafatullah@yahoo.co.in,"Ismail, Norli/F-8065-2010; Rafatullah, Mohd/C-8191-2009","Ismail, Norli/0000-0001-7941-7412; Rafatullah, Mohd/0000-0002-4590-3153; Nastro, Rosa Anna/0000-0003-1268-377X; Abbas, Syed Zaghum/0000-0002-4633-5944",Universiti Sains Malaysia Global Fellowship (USMGF),Universiti Sains Malaysia Global Fellowship (USMGF),,35,21,21,4,80,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0363-907X,1099-114X,,INT J ENERG RES,Int.

Since, this technology does not emit emissions and therefore also known as cleaner energy systems. For improving the performance of the fuel cell, it is highly important to understand the effect of operating conditions on its performance. In this context, experimental studies are conducted to understand the fundamentals of the fuel cell mechanism. In view of limited resources, hence numerical studies also become crucial for design of robust models for determining and optimizing the power density based on the dynamic operating conditions. In real scenario, there exist uncertainties in precise measurement of operating conditions such as the temperature and the flow rate of hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. In this work, the automated neural search (ANS) approach is proposed to formulate the relationships between power density and the operating conditions. Two types of uncertainties, namely the settings of the ANS approach and in the operating conditions are considered to formulate the robust models. Optimization performed on the robust model reveals that the operating temperature of 778 degrees C, hydrogen and oxygen flow rate of 1 L/min are the optimum settings for achieving maximum power density of 574.2 mW/cm(2).

This study simulates the TMMR using Aspen Plus software to find the appropriate monolith design and operation parameters to achieve optimal energy efficiency and hydrogen production within a small volume reactor. Different types of fuels, i.e. methane, methanol and ethanol, and various operating conditions, including molar flow rate of fuel (0.01-0.05 molls for combustion and 0.1-0.5 molls for reforming) and reforming pressure (3-5 atm), were investigated via thermodynamic equilibrium analysis. When methanol and ethanol were used as feedstocks, a reverse water-gas-shift reaction occurred, resulting in a decrease of energy efficiency. While using methane as a feedstock with a specific molar flow rate of 0.03 molls for the combustion reaction, 0.30 molls for the reforming reaction, and a reforming pressure of 4 atm, significant improvement of efficiency was observed. At the same time, the performance of the TMMR design was simulated based on the surface area of different sizes and configurations of monolith, i.e. parallel and checked arrangements, by using a kinetic based model approach. The highest efficiency achieved was from the checked arrangement of monolith with 200 cpsi of cell density, 150 mm of diameter and length, and exchange area of around 1.5 m(2). This design requires a small space of only 2.65 L in volume to provide 129 kW of hydrogen energy production with 44.0% efficiency. In conclusion, the proposed design and conditions could be a benchmark for future research on efficient compact reformers for vehicular applications. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, the power performance and degradation rate in SMFCs are limited by the low concentration of dissolved oxygen on the cathode. Therefore, in this study, SMFCs with comb-type cathode electrodes with carbon cloths exposed partly to air and embedded partly in the reactor substrate were designed and operated. They were utilized for enhancing the power density and the effect of three different exposed areas of cathode electrode for improving transfer of oxygen. Results showed that the power density reached 3.77 x 10(-2) mW/m(2) for 75% of the (M-A75) exposed area, which was 1.93 times than that of 50% of the (M-A50) exposed area and 6.44 times than that of 0% (i.e., completely immersed; M-A0) exposed area. These results indicated that the exposed area of the cathode electrode had a positive effect on the power performance of SMFCs and would reduce the impedance of the cathode. These findings would apparently offer useful information on the feasibility of SMFCs for wastewater treatment applications in the future.","[Wang, Chin-Tsan; Ou, Yun-Ting] Natl Ilan Univ, Dept Mech & Electromech Engn, Yilan, Taiwan; [Lee, Yao-Cheng; Yang, Yung-Chin] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Inst Mat Sci & Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chong, Wen-Tong] Univ Malaya, Dept Mech Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Sangeetha, Thangavel; Yan, Wei-Mon] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Energy & Refrigerating Air Conditioning Engn, Taipei, Taiwan","Wang, CT (corresponding author), Natl Ilan Univ, Dept Mech & Electromech Engn, Yilan, Taiwan.; Yan, WM (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Energy & Refrigerating Air Conditioning Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.",ctwang@niu.edu.tw; wmyan@ntut.edu.tw,"Wang, Chin-Tsan/D-1269-2015; Chong, Wen Tong/B-8396-2010","Wang, Chin-Tsan/0000-0003-0989-076X; Chong, Wen Tong/0000-0002-9208-9908","MOST TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 103-2221-E-197-022-MY3, 106-2622-E-197-007-CC3, 106-2221-E-197-019, 106-2923-E-197-001-MY3]","The authors would like to acknowledge the generous funding support from MOST Taiwan under contract # MOST 103-2221-E-197-022-MY3, 106-2622-E-197-007-CC3, 106-2221-E-197-019 and 106-2923-E-197-001-MY3.",,59,20,21,1,51,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

Besides, using a PGM catalyst makes the DMFC expensive. Many non-platinum catalysts were developed but most of them produce hydrogen peroxide that is toxic to the cathode and membrane that reduces the performances of the fuel cell. Thus, this study proposes a novel non-platinum catalyst that produced water as main product instead of hydrogen peroxide. CoPc/C-W18O49 is prepared via pyrolysis and they demonstrate as a promising catalyst to replace PGM in acidic media. As a semiconductor metal oxide, W18O49 has interesting properties and is used as a catalyst support to enhance the reactivity of the oxygen reduction reaction. W18O49 were synthesized first through a solvo-thermal process and then mixed with CoPc/C via pyrolysis at 700 degrees C, and they were also synthesized in the reverse order. The catalyst was physically characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and chemically characterized by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Rotating Ring-Disc Electrode (RRDE) analysis for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The results showed that the supported Nanowires (W18O49) are not transformed to WO3 after the pyrolysis process. The prepared catalyst, which is inert in the methanol environment electrolyte, has shown catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction in acidic media and has a 3.81 electron transfer, which produces water as the main product. The catalyst has comparable performance with other macrocycle catalysts with modified structures.","[Karim, N. A.; Kamarudin, S.

For the first time, this research focused on the development of the MEC biocathode out of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) for the purpose of hydrogen production based on the previously proposed hypothesis. SRB were initially enriched from a mixed culture source during the ex-situ SRB enrichment stage. Two different MEC bioathodes-namely, the MEC origin (MEC-O) biocathode and the microbial fuel cell-MEC (MFC-MEC) biocathode-were then developed through two different enrichment procedures during the in-situ SRB enrichment stage. Hydrogen gas was the main product of the MEC-O biocathode with a low detection of methane, while methane was detected as the sole product of the MFC-MEC biocathode system. Therefore, the MEC-O biocathode system was selected during the enhancement stage to increase the biocathode MEC performance. It was shown in the study, that in the enhancement stage of the MEC-O biocathode, the concentration of sodium sulphate in the cathodic medium, the hydrogen supply during the enrichment stage and pH of the cathodic medium could significantly affect the MEC performance in terms of the hydrogen production rate, the onset potential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the cathodic charge transfer resistance. The hydrogen production was improved significantly by about 6 times from 0.31 to 1.85 m(3) H-2/(m(3) d) during the enhancement stage, while the methane production was totally hindered. The linear sweep voltammetry analysis displayed a 430-mV (equal to about 1 kWh/m(3) of energy input) reduction of the HER onset potential in the biocathode system compared to that of a non-inoculated graphite felt cathode.

The effect of biofilm formation on power generation over time was also evaluated and found that an effective biofilm with the discrete distribution of single layer microorganisms can produce high power corresponding to low charge transfer resistance. The growth of biofilm in multilayers consisting of outnumbered dead cells in the vicinity of the electrode surface caused the polarization resistance and diffusion resistance resulting in a sharp drop in the current generation. The removal of multilayer biofilm from the anode surface positively influenced the cell performance which led to a rapid increase in current generation and thus revealed that effective biofilm predominated by live cells can be an emergent factor for achieving maximum performance in MFC.

Now, facing the fact that the water content directly impacts the degrading performance of SMFCs during the composting process, a technique of the highly effective thickener and stabilizer using Xanthan 80 Smoother flow (SF) and a drainage design would be utilized in the system undergoing a series of studies to evaluate its performance on SMFCs. Results show that using Xanthan 80 (SF) can enhance the power performance of SMFCs significantly because of its excellent ability to keep the compost moist throughout and prevent the gravitational effect from the accumulation of water at the bottom of the chamber.

Question arisen for its power quality and stability during an event of fault to the system. Henceforth this study would experiment the effects of different placement and type of faults to a microgrid. This study is conducted using MATLAB for simulation of suggested models in experimenting with the fault type and their placement which differs by 2 kilometers. Fault is triggered for 0.3 seconds from 0.2 to 0.5 seconds. Data obtained from the simulations shows that in case of fault occurring at a location near to the PV cells, the power system has a higher stability during an asymmetrical fault than of symmetrical fault. In the case where the fault is triggered farther than the first location, the power system shows a higher stability from a symmetrical fault in comparison to asymmetrical fault. In terms of comparing types of fault, it is observed that symmetrical fault causes larger instability towards the power system when it occurs nearer to the PV cells contradicting that of asymmetrical fault. Droop control and fault current limiter are a few of the methods to mitigate this instability that occurs within an autonomous microgrid due to fault. For future researches, it is recommended that simulation should not only be limited using MATLAB software, other software such as PSS Adept should also be considered.","[Pungut, N. A. F.

Subsequently, ORR activities of the catalysts were determined electrochemically using a conventional three-electrode cell via cyclic voltammetry with a rotating disc electrode, the results of which indicated that the synthesized catalysts had a marked electrocatalytic activity towards ORR in acid media. Among the synthesized catalysts, that functionalized using 2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)- 1,3,5-triazine as nitrogen source had the highest electrocatalytic activity with the highest onset potential (0.98 V/SHE) and limiting current density (5.12 mA cm(-2)).

Light irradiation, initial dye concentration, aeration, pH and cathode electrode are the operating parameters that might give contribution in the efficiency of PFC system. The degradation of RB5 depends on the presence of light irradiation and solar light gives better performance to degrade the azo dye. The azo dye with low initial concentration decolorizes faster compared to higher initial concentration and presence of aeration in PFC system would enhance its performance. Reactive Black 5 rapidly decreased at higher pH due to the higher amount of OH generated at higher pH and Pt-loaded carbon (Pt/C) was more suitable to be used as cathode in PFC system compared to Cu foil and Fe foil. The rapid decolorization of RB5 would increase their voltage output and in addition, it would also increase their V-oc,V- J(sc) and P-max.

Among the development of new energy technologies, modelling and optimization of energy processes with pollution reduction, sufficient efficiency and low emission are considered one of the most promising areas of study. Despite affecting factors in PEMFC functionality, providing a reliable model for PEMFC is the key of performance optimization challenge. In this paper, fuzzy cognitive map has been used for modelling PEMFC system that is directed to provide a dynamic cognitive map from the affecting factors of the system. Controlling and modification of the system performance in various conditions is more practical by correlations among the performance factors of the PEMFC derived from fuzzy cognitive maps. On the other hand, the information of fuzzy cognitive map modelling is applicable for modification of neural networks structure for providing more accurate results based on the extracted knowledge from the cognitive map and visualization of the system's performance. Finally, a rule based fuzzy cognitive map has been used that can be implemented for decision making to control the system. This rule-based approach provides interpretability while enhancing the performance of the overall system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This has involved the continuous monitoring of the outlet gas composition during CH4 operation and H-2 exposure. A degradation rate in the cell voltage (similar to 1.33 mV h(-1)) is observed during 100 h operation with dry CH4. Carbon is detected in the Ni-SDC anode after the stability test but only in the portion of the anode closest to the fuel channel. No carbon is detected at the electrolyte-anode interface, which is the likely reason that the cell performance remains relatively stable. The information obtained from SEM and gas outlet composition analyses can be explained by a process whereby most of the CH4 that reacts decomposes into H-2 and C in the Ni-SDC anode near the fuel channel. H-2 then makes its way to the anode-electrolyte interface where it is electrochemically oxidized to H2O which can also react with any C that may have formed, leaving behind C primarily at the fuel channel. When an aged cell is exposed to H-2, carbon-containing gases (CO, CH4 and CO2) are released, indicating that some carbon has been removed from the anode.

Their electronic conductivities displayed semiconducting behavior (i. e. increase with temperature rise) between 300 and 500 degrees C and metallic behavior (i.e. decrease with temperature rise) from 500 to 900 degrees C. SrNb0.1Ta0.1Fe0.8O3-delta provided the highest electrical conductivity that reaches 300 S cm(-1) at 500 degrees C. The thermal expansion coefficients for SrNb0.2-xTaxFe0.8O3-delta were lower than those reported for cobalt-containing perovskite cathodes. They varied from 12.83 x 10(-6) to 16.31 x 10(-6) K-1 between 30 and 810 degrees C.

Current research of conductive polymer composite material has reported about in-plane conductivity that was often higher than through-plane conductivity, which contradicted with the target of applications that required higher electrical conductivity in the through-plane direction. Therefore, electrical conductivity in parallel and transverse to extrusion directions were investigated. The general-effective media and modified fibre contact model were adapted to predict the electrical conductivity of the composite material. The experimental conductivity data of polypropylene/milled carbon fibre composites for transverse and parallel directions were not correlated with the general-effective media model with 2.009 and 0.663S/cm, respectively, at the highest filler loading of 80wt.%. This disagreement was due to various critical exponential, t values (2-3.25) that were obtained in this study. However, the modified fibre contact model seemed to have good agreement with the experimental data in the parallel to extrusion direction. This model was unable to predict electrical conductivity in the transverse direction due to lack of orientation occurring in that direction. The electrical conductivity increased as the filler loading increased as explained in percolation theory. Predicting the electrical conductivity of conductive polymer composites material is still in the preliminary stages where the researcher often obtains fluctuating agreement with the experimental values. Thus, contact between filler and orientation is considered as the main factor that influences the electrical conductivity and mechanical strength of the conductive polymer composites material.","[Radzuan, Nabilah Afiqah Mohd; Sulong, Abu Bakar; Somalu, Mahendra Rao] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Sulong, Abu Bakar] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, Ukm Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia","Radzuan, NAM (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",afiqahmradzuan@gmail.com,"Radzuan, Nabilah Afiqah Mohd/Q-5822-2017","Radzuan, Nabilah Afiqah Mohd/0000-0003-0859-6112; Sulong, Abu Bakar/0000-0003-4637-1758; Somalu, Mahendra Rao/0000-0003-1667-693X","Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE)Ministry of Education, Malaysia [FRGS/1/2013/TK04/UKM/01/2, AP-2013-010, DIP-2014-006]; MyBrain15 programme","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE), grant number FRGS/1/2013/TK04/UKM/01/2, AP-2013-010, DIP-2014-006, and MyBrain15 programme.",,33,7,7,0,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0021-9983,1530-793X,,J COMPOS MATER,J.

Therefore, mesoporous Co3O4 nanoflakes were prepared by a two-step hydrothermal method and were employed as the cathode catalyst in a double-chamber microbial fuel cell (MFC) to explore its ORR activity for electricity generation. The electrochemical tests suggested that addition of Co3O4 nanoflakes enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of the cathode significantly. Besides, the cathode with a higher concentration of Co3O4 nanoflakes (COF-2) showed faster ORR kinetics as compared to the bare cathode. Evidently, COF-2 achieved an exchange current density of 4.18 mA/cm(2), which was 3.2 times higher as compared to the bare cathode. Consequently, this improved ORR activity increased the power output in MFC. COF-2 obtained a maximum power density of 347 +/- 7 mW/m(2), which was approximately 8 times higher than the bare cathode. The enhanced ORR activity and improved electric output in the MFC can be attributed to the mesoporous nature of Co3O4 nanoflakes that exposed a higher number of ORR active sites at the cathode surface. Overall, mesoporous Co3O4 nanoflakes proved to be highly efficient and ca. 30 times cheaper than platinum, therefore, can be preferred in large-scale MFC applications over other expensive cathode catalysts.

Moreover, the effect of CNT inclusion with MnO2 was also investigated for ORR. The physical and electrochemical properties of the MnO2/CNT were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray (FESEM/EDX), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Mott-Schottky and Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) analysis. CV showed higher currents for the ORR in MnO2/CNT than CNT; however, ORR current dropped when the MnO2 loading was increased from 20-40%. The EIS analysis showed that charge-transfer resistance for MnO2/CNT was significantly lower compared to the MnO2 indicating that MnO2 has good contact with CNT and the composite possess high electrical conductivity. Mott-Schottky results demonstrated that incorporation of CNT into MnO2 resulted in producing larger electron density in n-type MnO2/CNT compared to MnO2 which is liable for efficient electron donation from the Mn3+ to adsorbed oxygen in the rate determining step. RDE results showed that MnO2/CNT follows 4e(-) transfer pathway, indicating its ability to act as an effective ORR electrocatalyst.","[Woon, Chee Wai; Islam, Mohammed Amirul; Ethiraj, Baranitharan; Ong, Huei Ruey; Cheng, Chin Kui; Khan, Md.

In this study, for the first time, specimens of different metallic materials with smooth and rough surfaces, including Cu-based alloys and porous Ni plates whose sintering temperature was in the range of 900 degrees C-1100 degrees C, were investigated with regard to their possible application as anodes in MFCs. The results show that MFCs equipped with a Cu-Ag alloy anode could produce a higher power performance with an open -circuit voltage of 0.65 V and a power density of 1141.69 mW m(-2) compared to the other anodes of Cu-Zn and Cu-Ni-Zn alloys. The reason is that the performances of anodes are proportional to the electrical conductivity of the various alloys. In addition, the porosity of the specimens is 20.3% for the Ni-1100 degrees C and 58.4% for the Ni-900 degrees C anode material. The conductivity of the anodes decreases with increasing porosity, which, in turn, will result in a lower power performance. Here, the Ni-1100 anode applied in MFCs displays a better performance with an open -circuit voltage of 0.56 V, a limiting current density of 3140 mA m(-2), and a corresponding maximum power density of 448 mW m(-2). The output power density could be maintained at 450 mW m(-2) after a test of 50 h. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

But facing the slow dynamic response and low power density of MFCs, a technique using external physical exciting with an electrical force, with an intensity ranging from 0 to 8.8 kV/m, was applied in this study to ascertain the bioelectrochemical dynamic response of MFCs. Results show that the rise time of MFCs under external electric impact, regardless of electrical intensity, was shorter than in a case of without electric impacting. Evidence shows that external electric impact gives a significant positive impact on the dynamic performance of MFCs. The dynamic power response of a system under cases of electric impacting is better than in cases of without (i.e., MFCoriginal). In addition, a maximum electric charge of 358.9 x 10(-3)C in a system whose Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) was-219 mV was obtained in the case of MFCE-4.8 and was 4.07 times that of the MFCoriginal..

However, none of the commercial AEMs behave ideally under alkaline operation conditions and developing appropriate membranes is one of the major hurdles to the durability and performance of anion exchange membrane fuel cells. Here we demonstrate a simple and efficient strategy of using nanofibrous materials, activated by radiation and functionalized with ionic groups to fabricate highly durable and conductive membranes with polycationic side chains. Two series of AEMs were prepared by radiation induced emulsion grafting of vinylbenzyl chloride onto syndiotactic polypropylene and nylon-66 nanofibrous sheets followed by crosslinking and introducing quaternary ammonium groups. A strong correlation was found between the choice of nanofibrous substrate as well as crosslinking degrees with water uptake, ion conductivity and stability of the membranes. A well-developed phase separated morphology was confirmed and the membranes with ion exchange capacities of 1.6-2.1 mmol g(-1) showed high ionic conductivity, low methanol permeability and excellent alkaline stability. A hydroxide ion conductivity as high as 132 mS cm(-1) was achieved at 80 degrees C and it was exceptionally retained at up to 90% after evaluation by accelerated degradation testing in 1 M NaOH at 80 degrees C for 672 h. A Pt-catalyzed fuel cell using these nanofibrous composite membranes showed a peak power density of above 120 mW cm(-2) at 80 degrees C under 90% relative humidity.

The results were compared with another similar MFC that used a bare graphite felt (BGF) bioanode. The anode surfaces provided active sites for the adhesion of the bacterial consortium (NAR-2) and the biodegradation of mono azo dye C.I. Acid Red 27. As a result, bioelectricity was generated in both MFCs. A 98% decolourisation rate was achieved using the TC-MGF bioanode under a fed-batch operation mode. Maximum power densities for BGF and TC-MGF bioanodes were 458.8 +/- 5.0 and 940.3 +/- 4.2 mW m(-2), respectively. GC-MS analyses showed that the dye was readily degraded in the presence of the TC-MGF bioanode. The MFC using the TC-MGF bioanode showed a stable biofilm with no biomass leached out for more than 300 h operation. In general, MFC performance was substantially improved by the fabricated TC-MGF bioanode. It was also found that the TC-MGF bioanode with the stable biofilm presented the nature of exopolysaccharide (EPS) structure, which is suitable for the biodegradation of the azo dye. In fact, the EPS facilitated the shuttling of electrons to the bioanode for the generation of bioelectricity.","[Kardi, Seyedeh Nazanin; Ibrahim, Norahim; Rashid, Noor Aini Abdul] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Biosci & Med Engn, Dept Biosci & Hlth Sci, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Darzi, Ghasem Najafpour] Babol Noshirvani Univ Technol, Biotechnol Res Lab, Fac Chem Engn, Babol Sar 4714871167, Iran; [Villasenor, Jose] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Inst Chem & Environm Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Ciudad Real, Spain","Kardi, SN (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Biosci & Med Engn, Dept Biosci & Hlth Sci, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",nkseyedeh2@live.utm.my; norahim@fbb.utm.my,"Camacho, Jose Villasenor/ABH-4239-2020","Camacho, Jose Villasenor/0000-0001-5865-0610","Ministry of Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [4F505]","The author wished to acknowledge the Ministry of Education Malaysia for providing the Fundamental Research Grant Sheme (FRGS), Vote No. 4F505 to carry out present research and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) for providing the experimental and analytical facilities.",,44,5,5,0,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

However, platinum reduces the number of active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the reaction between platinum and methanol and the strong adsorption of carbon monoxide molecules on the platinum surface, and in addition, platinum is very expensive. Hence, this study proposes cobalt phthalocyanineicarbon-tungsten oxide nanowires (W18O49) as a non-platinum catalyst for the cathode side of a DMFC. We determined the kinetic parameters of the catalyst and investigated the factors affecting the reaction. The factors involved in the examination of the significant parameters were the synthetic method, the pyrolysis temperature, the mass ratio of CoPc to carbon, the mass ratio of CoPc/C to tungsten hexachloride and the molarity of tungsten hexachloride. The optimum parameters were determined to be a pyrolysis temperature of 600 degrees C and a mass ratio of CoPc/C:WCI6 of 1.90. These conditions produced a peak potential at 0.63 V vs. RHE, a mass activity of 1.76 A g(catalyst)(-1) at 0.65 V, an average electron transfer number of 3.9 with water as the main product, and an electron transfer number of 3.9 at 0.65 V. Finally, the results showed that the non-platinum catalyst (which is less expensive than platinum) has similar characteristics to platinum. The single cell performance test showed that the power density is 9.0 mW cm(-2). The catalyst has comparable performance with other macrocycle catalysts with modified structures.

This paper proposed a novel system for hydrogen and fresh water production in which a Stirling engine used instead of a condenser, for the places with abundant access to solar radiation and sea, and least to freshwater sources. This proposal leads to further utilization of streams' exergy through the system instead of wasting to the environment, and further power production by the engine followed by the higher products. The electrolyzer employed beside Reverse Osmosis (RO) desalination system, and takes full advantages of highly concentrated brine stream of desalination, eliminating the wastewater rejection through proposed system leading to attaining a near-ZLD approach in fresh water and hydrogen production. This reduces the adverse impacts of desalination's wastewater on the environment. A thermodynamic and exergy analysis is carried out to compare the superiority of this study and investigate the effect of some key parameters on the overall performance of the system as well. The results showed that replacing the condenser by a Stirling engine reduces the exergy destruction through heat transfer from CO2 to an LNG unit. Exergy destruction was reduced from 16.7% to 8.8% for the above configuration for an ideal Stirling engine that exploits it to produce extra power which its minimum is at least 9 kW and 15 kW higher than CO2 and LNG power productions. Moreover, Entering RO brine stream, wasting 2.58 kW exergy, to the electrolyzer leads to NaCIO and H-2 production besides removing brine stream. In a power plant, sodium hypochlorite is used for disinfection of cooling systems and hydrogen can be used as a source of energy in fuel cells. An examination of some thermodynamic factors showed that higher CO2 turbine inlet pressure has an optimum value in producing fresh water and hydrogen, while the higher CO2 turbine inlet temperature slightly reduces the productions rate. The more recovery ratio also causes a sharp reduction in hydrogen production, whereas it has an optimum amount of fresh water production at recovery ratio equals to 0.47. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Bioanodes enriched at a potential of +0.2 V (vs. standard hydrogen electrode) were able to sustain their oxidation activity when the anode potential was varied from -0.3 up to +1.0 V. Chronoamperometric test revealed that the bioanode produced peak current density of 0.36 A/m(2) and 0.37 A/m(2) at applied potential 0 and +0.6 V, respectively. Meanwhile hydrogen production at the biocathode was proportional to the applied potential, in the range from -0.5 to -1.0 V. The highest production rate was 7.4 L H-2/(m(2) cathode area)/day at -1.0 V cathode potential. A limited current output at the bioanode could halt the biocathode capability to generate hydrogen.

In this study, the properties of zirconia co-doped with 10 mol% Sc and 1 mol% Ce (scandiaceria-stabilized-zirconia, 10Sc1CeSZ) electrolyte synthesized by the microwave-assisted glycine nitrate process (MW-GNP) were determined. The effects of microwave heating on the sintering temperature, microstructure, densification and ionic conductivity of the 10Sc1CeSZ electrolyte were evaluated. The phase identification, microstructure and specific surface area of the prepared powder were investigated using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller technique, respectively. Using microwave heating, a single cubic-phase powder was produced with nanosized crystallites (19.2 nm) and a high specific surface area (16 m(2)/g). It was found that the relative density, porosity and total ionic conductivity of the 10Sc1CeSZ electrolyte are remarkably influenced by the powder processing method and the sintering temperature. The pellet sintered at 1400 degrees C exhibited a maximum ionic conductivity of 0.184 S/cm at 800 degrees C. This is the highest conductivity value of a scandia-stabilized-zirconia based electrolyte reported in the literature for this electrolyte type. The corresponding value of the activation energy of electrical conductivity was found to be 0.94 eV in the temperature range of 500-800 degrees C. Overall, the use of microwave heating has successfully improved the properties of the 10Sc1CeSZ electrolyte for application in an IT-SOFC.","[Jais, Abdul Azim; Ali, S. A.

The flower-like Co3O4 was prepared by a hydrothermal route. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results suggested that flower-like Co3O4 contained positively charged ions i.e., Co2+/Co3+ on its surface that probably acted as ORR active sites. The electrochemical tests demonstrated that flower-like Co3O4 enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of the cathode significantly as the onset potentials obtained in cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry were more positive than the bare cathode. Besides, Tafel plots showed that Co3O4 increased the electron transfer kinetics and achieved an exchange current density of 2.46 A/m(2), which was similar to 30% higher than bare cathode. Subsequently, this improved ORR activity increased the power output in the MFC and a maximum power density of 248 mW/m(2) was achieved, which was 6.3 times higher than the bare cathode. The higher ORR activity and improved electric output in the MFC could be attributed to the excellent electrocatalytic activity of Co2+/Co3+ and mesoporous nature of flower-like Co3O4 that exposed extra active sites for oxygen molecules on the cathode surface.

One of the limitations of using graphite cathode is the slow kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction. Nitrogen doping has been demonstrated to be an efficient approach to regulate the electronic as well as surface characteristics of graphite cathode. Therefore, in this study nitrogen doping of graphite cathode was performed to determine the feasibility of H2O2 production and energy generation in a dual chamber MFC. An integrated approach of quantum chemical calculation in combination with experimental investigation was used. Quantum chemical calculations confirmed the production of H2O2 with the lowest Gibb's free energy of -63 kcal/mol. For validation, ammonia treatment of graphite cathode was performed. The XPS analysis of doped cathode revealed the presence of Graphitic-N functionalization with overall N1 s content of 2.96%. Cyclic voltammetric analysis of nitrogen doped cathode further confirmed the production of H2O2 at the peak current value of -4.0 mA and on-set potential of -0.55 V. Following CV analysis, hydrogen peroxide production experiments were performed in a dual chamber MFC. Maximum of 175 mg/L of H2O2 was obtained with simultaneous power generation of 47.61 W/m(3), indicating the synergetic effect of nitrogen doped cathode. Thus, from the findings of quantum chemical evaluation and experimental investigation, it is concluded that nitrogen doping of graphite cathode is an efficient approach to improve the performance of MFC in terms of H2O2 production and power generation.

The main challenge for such CNFs lies in the low yield and very low apparent density of the product, which hamper their applications as electrode materials in batteries and fuel cells. Herein, BC pellicles (8 wt%) are simultaneously employed as a substrate and a sacrificial microreactor, thus allowing the carbonization in its unique porous network. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid serves as a carbon source and a nitrogen source, while cobalt plays the role of a recyclable pore-creating template to create a 3D nitrogen-doped graphite carbon with hierarchically porous structure (HPGC). The resultant HPGC exhibits a large specific surface area, high porosity, and large amount of structural defects, which translate into very high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability. The synthesis route, the catalyst structure, and the proposed mechanism open novel avenue and insights to develop next-generation metal-free ORR catalysts.","[Yu, Jie; Yang, Guangming; Zhong, Yijun; Zhou, Wei; Shao, Zongping] Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem Engn, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, 5 Xin Mofan Rd, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Sunarso, Jaka] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Jalan Simpang Tiga, Kuching 93350, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Zhuang, Wei] Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Biotechnol & Pharmaceut Engn, Natl Engn Tech Res Ctr Biotechnol, 30 Puzhu South Rd, Nanjing 211816, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wei; Zhu, Zhonghua] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem Engn, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Shao, Zongping] Curtin Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Perth, WA 6845, Australia","Zhou, W (corresponding author), Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem Engn, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, 5 Xin Mofan Rd, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhouwei1982@njtech.edu.cn; shaozp@njtech.edu.cn,"Shao, Zongping/AAY-8177-2020; , 周嵬/B-1083-2012; Yang, Guangming/AAH-4806-2020; Sunarso, Jaka/B-9077-2008; Zhu, Zhonghua/A-7047-2019; Zhong, Yijun/H-1647-2013","Shao, Zongping/0000-0002-4538-4218; , 周嵬/0000-0003-0322-095X; Yang, Guangming/0000-0003-3792-5018; Sunarso, Jaka/0000-0002-5234-7431; Zhu, Zhonghua/0000-0003-2144-8093; Zhong, Yijun/0000-0003-4112-7115; YU, Jie/0000-0003-1133-181X","National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21576135]; CAS Interdisciplinary Innovation Team; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Program for Changjiang ScholarsProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT); Program for Jiangsu Specially-Appointed Professors; Youth Fund in Jiangsu Province [BK20150945]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP170104660, DP130102151]","This work was financially supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China under Contract No. 21576135, the CAS Interdisciplinary Innovation Team, the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, the Program for Changjiang Scholars, the Program for Jiangsu Specially-Appointed Professors, the Youth Fund in Jiangsu Province under Contract No. BK20150945, and the Australian Research Council under Contract Nos.

Therefore, the different dosages of polyaniline (PANI) (10 wt%, 20 wt%, 30 wt%, 40 wt% and 50 wt %) were incorporated into PVDF-HFP blend to fabricate PVDF-HFP/PANI polymer electrolyte membrane by using breath-figure method. The FTIR peaks of PVDF-HFP and PVDF-HFP/PANI membrane confirms the successful incorporation of PANI into PVDF-HFP blend, while TGA, DSC and XRD analysis shows the PANI effect on stability and ionic conductivity of PVDF-HFP membrane. The PVDF-HFP/PANI membrane with 30 wt% PANI found superior with the highest porosity of 83%, electrolyte uptake of 270% and ionic conductivity of 1.96 mS cm(-1); however, the other concentrations of PANI were also effective and enhanced the performance of PVDF-HFP membrane. This shows the improved performances of PVDF-HFP membrane were attributed to successful incorporation of PANI and the proposed membrane can be a suitable alternative PEM or a separator for energy devices.

In MFCs, H2O2 is produced as a result of two-electron oxygen reduction at graphite cathode surface. However, due to poor catalytic properties of graphite cathode high yields of H2O2 are not attained. Therefore, this study investigates the feasibility of in situH(2)O(2) production in MFC for recalcitrant wastewater treatment. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTSIn this study, a dual chamber MFC was used. A heat-treated graphite electrode was used as cathode and Nafion-117 as membrane. Cyclic voltammetric analysis was also performed to study the potential of heat-treated graphite cathode for H2O2 production. Experimentally, a maximum of 140 mg L-1 of H2O2 was produced with simultaneous power generation of 33.52 W m(-3). Consequently, in situ Fenton oxidation experiments were performed and compared with conventional Fenton oxidation using a recalcitrant pollutant i.e. Acid Blue 113 dye. On average, 24% difference between the performance of the Fenton and in situ Fenton oxidation was observed while 42% reduction in the cost of process was obtained in the case of the in situ Fenton oxidation process. CONCLUSIONThe current study proved that MFC is a sustainable solution for in situ Fenton oxidation (followed by H2O2 production) with less requirement of H2O2.

A transition metal cation, particularly Cu, is added into the (Mn,Co)(3)O-4 to improve the long-term stability of the interconnect materials for low-to-intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). In this work, fine-crystalline (Cu,Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel powders with an average crystallite size of 21 nm were successfully synthesized via the citric acid-nitrate method. The potential for use as a coating material for low-to-intermediate-temperature SOFC interconnects was explored. According to the TG curves, IR spectra, and XRD patterns, 800 degrees C is recommended as the minimum calcination temperature for (Cu,Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel materials. Compared with (Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel materials, the addition of Cu does not induce significant changes in the crystal structure but markedly improves the electrical conductivity (116 Scrn(-1)) and the activation energy (0.394 eV) of the (Cu,Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel. Overall, the sol-gel derived (Cu,Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel can be used as a coating material for low-to-intermediate-temperature SOFC interconnects and is superior to (Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel because high electrical conductivity is preferred to minimize ohmic losses between the electrodes of adjacent cells.","[Mah, Joelle C.

The influence of calcination temperature and sodium alginate loading fraction on the properties of the synthesized GDC nanocomposite powders was investigated. Characterization was performed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, thermo-gravimetric analysis, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis. It was observed that the particle size and the surface area of the produced GDC nanocomposite powders are dominantly controlled by the calcination temperature, while the effect of sodium alginate loading fraction is limited by the range of the calcination temperature. In this study, the smallest mesoporous GDC nanocomposite powder with cubic fluorite structure (8 nm crystallite size and 3.05 +/- 0.005 m(2)/g surface area) was synthesized using 2 wt% of sodium alginate at a calcination temperature of 550 degrees C (for 4 h). The results of this study could help to perceive the influence of the basic processing variables on the particle size and the other physiochemical properties of GDC nanocomposite powders produced by the ionic-gelation method.","[Pezeshkpour, Shaghayegh; Salamatinia, Babak; Horri, Bateman Amini] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Engn, Chem Engn Discipline, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia; [Abdullah, Ahmad Zuhairi] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Chem Engn, Engn Campus, Nibong Tebal 14300, Penang, Malaysia; [Horri, Bateman Amini] Univ Surrey, Fac Engn & Phys Sci, Dept Chem & Proc Engn, Surrey GU2 7XH, England","Salamatinia, B; Horri, BA (corresponding author), Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Engn, Chem Engn Discipline, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia.; Horri, BA (corresponding author), Univ Surrey, Fac Engn & Phys Sci, Dept Chem & Proc Engn, Surrey GU2 7XH, England.",babak.salamatinia@monash.edu; b.aminihorri@surrey.ac.uk,,"Amini Horri, Bahman/0000-0003-2747-1542; Abdullah, Ahmad Zuhairi/0000-0001-6394-2917","Ministry of Science, Education, and Innovation (MOSTI) of Malaysia [03-02-10-SF0259]","The author would like to gratefully acknowledge the Ministry of Science, Education, and Innovation (MOSTI) of Malaysia for providing research funding under the e-Sciemce scheme grant number 03-02-10-SF0259.",,55,6,6,6,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-8842,1873-3956,,CERAM INT,Ceram.

The anode was compacted by pressing, after which sintering was conducted in a conventional furnace at 1200 degrees C. A high-energy ball mill was used to mix the Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9(SDC) nanopowder and NiO. A pressing technique was applied to fabricate the NiO-SDC/SDC anode cells. The effect of different compaction pressures (200, 300, and 400 MPa) on the performance of the anodes was investigated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at an intermediate temperature range (600-800 degrees C). The nanoindentation technique and Archimedes method, which were used to measure stiffness and bulk density, respectively, revealed that increases in porosity were correlated with decreases in compaction pressure. High electrochemical performance can be achieved if the compaction pressure is decreased and the operating temperature is increased because of hydrogen spillover during the operation.

The reactors were tested for the simultaneous biodegradation of real dye textile wastewater (RTW) and the generation of bioelectricity. The results of digital image processing revealed a maximum coverage area on the biocathodes by microalgal cells of 42%. The atmospheric and diffused CO2 could enable good algal growth and its immobilized operation on the cathode electrode. The biocathode-SCMFCs outperformed an open circuit voltage (OCV), which was 18%-43% higher than the control. Furthermore, the maximum volumetric power density achieved was 123.2 +/- 27.5 mW m(-3). The system was suitable for the treatment of RTW and the removal/decrease of COD, colour and heavy metals. High removal efficiencies were observed in the SCMFCs for Zn (98%) and COD (92-98%), but the removal efficiencies were considerably lower for Cr (54-80%). We observed that this single chamber MFC simplifies a double chamber system. The bio-electrochemical performance was relatively low, but the treatment capacity of the system seems encouraging in contrast to previous studies. A proof-of-concept experiment demonstrated that the microalgal biocathode could operate in air exposed conditions, seems to be a promising alternative to a Pt cathode and is an efficient and cost-effective approach to improve the performance of single chamber MFCs.

The present study was intended to examine both the electrogenic properties of B. cereus and its ability to inhibit methanogenesis in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). The potential influence of the incorporation of B. cereus into anaerobic sludge (AS) on the electrochemical activity was assessed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses. The CV of MFCs with B. cereus showed a strong redox peak, suggesting that B. cereus has electrogenetic properties. Moreover, the incorporation of B. cereus into AS provided an enhancement in the power generation (4.83 W/m(3)) and the CE (22%) of the MFC compared to the corresponding values for an MFC inoculated solely with AS (1.82 W/m(3), 12%). The increase in power generation could be due to the antimethanogenic property of B. cereus, which was evident from the 54% reduction in methane production. The results of this study suggest that the incorporation of microorganisms with electrogenic and antimethanogenic properties into AS promotes the formation of electtoactive biofflms and maximizes the power generation of MFCs by suppressing the methanogenesis.","[Islam, M.

The investigation of the sequential cyclic redox of nickel/scandia-stabilized-zirconia (Ni/ScSZ) SOFC anode films presented in this study is aimed at understanding the properties of screen-printed Ni/ScSZ anode films fabricated using a rheologically optimized ink under redox condition. An optimized NiO/ScSZ screen-printing ink containing 28 vol% of solids and 2 wt% binder was chosen for the fabrication of the anode films. The mechanical properties, DC conductivity and electrochemical performance of Ni/ScSZ films were measured between 0 and 15 cycles and related to the microstructural change of the anode. All these properties degraded with increasing redox cycles. The mechanical hardness of re-oxidized anode decreases from 8753 to 1314 MPa, while the DC conductivity of re-reduced anode decreases from 1400 to 410 S/cm at 800 A degrees C. Also, the anode polarization resistance increases from 0.75 to 2.7 Omega cm(2) at 800 A degrees C. This degradation is related to the separation of Ni particles, which reduces the density and Ni-Ni particle connectivity. The decrease in electrochemical performance can be related to a decrease in the anode triple-phase boundary density in the fabricated films. However, all the printed films remain stable with acceptable electrical and electrochemical performance without any cracks or delamination even after 15 cycles. This indicates that ink optimization through rheological testing is an important way to prevent crack formation in printed anode films that results from redox processes in real SOFC operating conditions.","[Somalu, Mahendra R.; Muchtar, Andanastuti] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Muchtar, Andanastuti] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Brandon, Nigel P.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England","Somalu, MR (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",mahen@ukm.edu.my,"Muchtar, Andanastuti/E-3806-2017","Muchtar, Andanastuti/0000-0002-1599-8964; Somalu, Mahendra Rao/0000-0003-1667-693X","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM); Ministry of Education Malaysia [DIP-2016-005, FRGS/2/2013/TK06/UKM/02/9]; RCUK Energy ProgrammeResearch Councils UK (RCUK); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/P024807/1, EP/M014045/1] Funding Source: researchfish","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support given by the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) and the Ministry of Education Malaysia via research sponsorships of DIP-2016-005 and FRGS/2/2013/TK06/UKM/02/9.

In this study, the co-sintering temperature of CGO electrolyte with anode layer was reduced by adding Li that acts as sintering additive. The prepared Li doped CGO (Li-CGO) were characterized by shrinkage analysis, atomic resolution analytical microscope (ARM) observation and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra. Meanwhile, the developed half-cell of MT-SOFC which was co-sintered at 1350-1500 degrees C with interval of 50 degrees C were characterized by its mechanical strength, gas tightness and microstructural analysis. The electrochemical performances of the cells were tested in anode-supported MT-SOFCs with configuration of Ni-CGO anode, Li-CGO electrolyte and LSCF-CGO cathode using humidified hydrogen as fuel and oxygen air as oxidant. MT-SOFCs fabricated with Li-CGO electrolyte were found to exhibit maximum power density of 60 Wm(-2) at 500 degrees C compared to 200 Wm(-2) for cells with unmodified CGO electrolyte. The poor performance of cell with Li-CGO electrolyte is probably due to the combined effects of (i) moderately dense electrolyte layer and (ii) appearance of electronic conductivity in Li-CGO electrolyte. Nevertheless, lowering the sintering temperature has shown good properties of the electrolyte materials, which allows the electrolyte materials and anode can be co-sintered together at lower temperature.","[Jamil, Siti Munira; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan; Rahman, Mukhlis A.; Jaafar, Juhana; Mohamed, Mohamad Azuwa; Yusop, Mohd Zamri Mohd; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr, Utm Johor Bahru 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Jamil, Siti Munira; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan; Rahman, Mukhlis A.; Jaafar, Juhana; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Chem & Energy Engn, Utm Johor Bahru 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Yusop, Mohd Zamri Mohd] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Mat, Fac Mech Engn, Utm Johor Bahru 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Tanemura, Masaki] Nagoya Inst Technol, Dept Frontier Mat, Showa Ku, Gokiso Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, Japan; [Mohamed, Mohamad Azuwa] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst SELFUEL, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia","Othman, MHD (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr, Utm Johor Bahru 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",hafiz@petroleum.utm.my,"Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan/J-8230-2015; Jaafar, Juhana/J-8353-2012; Mohamed, Mohamad Azuwa/F-1964-2018; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi/D-2643-2012; Mohd Zamri Mohd, Yusop/K-6600-2012","Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan/0000-0002-5842-2447; Jaafar, Juhana/0000-0002-7245-8155; Mohamed, Mohamad Azuwa/0000-0003-1662-5382; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi/0000-0003-0150-625X; Jamil, Siti Munira/0000-0003-0594-1523; Mohd Zamri Mohd, Yusop/0000-0003-0897-2712",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia [Q.J130000.2546.12H25]; Flagship UTMShine Project [Q.J130000.2446.03G29]; Nippon Sheet Glass Foundation for Materials Science and Engineering under Overseas Research Grant [Q.J130000.2446.03G29],"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under Research University Grant Tier 1 (Project number: Q.J130000.2546.12H25) and Flagship UTMShine (Project number: Q.J130000.2446.03G29), and Nippon Sheet Glass Foundation for Materials Science and Engineering under Overseas Research Grant Scheme (Project number: Q.J130000.2446.03G29).

Biodiesel is a renewable fuel used particularly in diesel engines. Currently, biodiesel is mainly produced through transesterification reactions catalyzed by chemical catalysts, which produces higher fatty acid alkyl esters in shorter reaction time. Although extensive investigations on enzymatic transesterification by downstream processing were carried out, enzymatic transesterification has yet to be used in scale-up since commercial lipases are chiefly limited to the cost as well as long reaction time. While numerous lipases were studied and proven to have the high catalytic capacity, still enzymatic reaction requires more investigation. To fill this gap, finding optimal conditions for the reaction such as alcohol and oil choice, water content, reaction time and temperature through proper reaction modelling and simulations as well as the appropriate design and use of reactors for large scale production are crucial issues that need to be accurately addressed. Furthermore, lipase concentration, alternative lipase resources through whole cell technology and genetic engineering, recent immobilizing materials including nanoparticles, and the capacity of enzyme to be reused are important criteria to be neatly investigated. The present work reviews the current biodiesel feedstock, catalysis, general and novel immobilizing materials, bioreactors for enzymatic transesterification, potential lipase resources, intensification technics, and process modelling for enzymatic transesterification.

SrFe0.5Ti0.5O3-delta powders were prepared with solution combustion, in which various precursor solutions were utilized with different mixing times. The precursor powders were calcined at a certain temperature that was determined via thermogravimetric and Fourier-transform infrared analyses. Each batch of calcined powders underwent X-ray diffraction to analyze the purity and phase formation of the yield. By increasing the mixing time to 45 h, pure cubic-structured SrFe0.5Ti0.5O3-delta powders were formed and the crystallite size decreased. The average crystallite size decreased from 30.46 to 28.96 nm with the increase of mixing time (from 5 to 45 h). The powders produced after 45 h of mixing exhibited pure phase. These powders were further analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The average particle sizes of 1.5849 and 1.6219 mu m were measured with the statistical distribution of micrographs, which were obtained from FESEM, and DLS analysis, respectively. Results obtained from EDX confirmed that the elements were homogenously distributed after 45 h of mixing. To examine the suitability of pure SrFe0.5Ti0.5O3-delta powders as fuel cell cathode material, electrical conductivity was measured, obtaining a value of 6.32 S cm(-1). This value is higher than the electrical conductivity of the same composition of powders synthesized using solid-state method. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the DMFC still faces several problems, such as sluggish methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction, as well as a high methanol crossover. In other areas of study, it is well-known that methanol can be photocatalytically oxidized by wide band gap semiconductors under solar illumination. Methanol has been used in photocatalytic water splitting to enhance the performance of photo-electrochemical cells (PECs). Therefore, by combining photocatalytic and electro-catalytic mechanisms, methanol is expected to promote a new type of photo assisted DMFC. In this work, the semiconductor TiO2 was used as a photo-catalyst in a PEC using a methanol solution. A TiO2 P25 suspension was cast onto carbon paper and then dried at 80 degrees C for 60 min. The photo-electrochemical measurements were carried out in a 3 arm electrochemical cell, using Pt wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. Linear scan voltammetry (LSV) was carried out using a 20 V/400 mA potentiostat. The current densities of the electrode were monitored with and without simulated solar illumination. From the investigation, the current density of the TiO2 electrode under solar illumination was higher than it was without solar illumination. However, the value is low due to the low activity of TiO2 under visible light illumination. Further studies were carried out by combining TiO2 with a carbon material and a noble metal alloy to maximize the current density. This modified photo-catalyst can be utilized in a new photo-assisted DMFC to produce higher electricity. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The optimization of the process was conducted via response surface method using Design Expert 6.0.10. Proximate and ultimate analysis of the solid waste from papaya peel, banana peel, vegetable waste, leftover rice, bagasse, pineapple peel, goat manure and poultry waste were conducted. The biogas content was analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD), while bio-fuel was analyzed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The screening test indicated that waste from goats fed grass and soy pellets was used for the bio-methanol production profiles because this biomass has the highest carbon (36.16%) and volatile solid (12.44 wt%) of the various tested biomass. From the profile analysis, the maximum value of bio-methanol produced is 2.49% with 74.24% of methane. The design of experiments shows that the actual bio-methanol concentration values vary from 0.51 to 5.19 and these values are not significantly different from the values (0.45-4.51 gL(-1)) predicted by the model. The optimal conditions for the production of bio-methanol were temperature of 32.72 degrees C, 11 days of hydraulic retention time and 0.40 g/L cell concentration for the production of 6.80 gL(-1) bio-methanol. The results showed that the goat manure had the most potential for bio-methanol production. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.","[Shamsul, N.

The NG catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The prepared NG catalysts were folded transparent films with wrinkles. The nitrogen content of the NG catalysts calculated from XPS varied from approximately 4.18%-7.40%. NG1 displayed the highest performance, with a remarkable reduction peak of 0.39 mA cm(-2) at -0.21 V vs. Ag/AgCl in alkaline media. A direct correlation between total nitrogen content and catalytic activity was not observed, but catalytic activity was dependent on the nature of the nitrogen configurations.

As the first method, fermentation of cheese whey for production of lactic acid, in an immobilized cell reactor (ICR) was successfully carried out. The immobilisation of Lactobacillus bulgaricus was performed by the enriched cells cultured media harvested at exponential growth phase. Furthermore, the FTIR analysis has been done to prove the production of lactic acid. The COD removal during the continuous process for both whey and concentrated whey was above 70% which showed the capability of reaction for wastewater treatment. The cells were immobilised by sodium alginate as a perfect polymer in this regard. The maximum produced lactic acid from whey was 10.7 gr(-1) at 0.125 h(-1) and 19.5 g l(-1) from concentrated whey at 0.063 h(-1). Finally it can be concluded that the process is efficient for lactic acid production and COD removal simultaneously. As the second studied method, whey and concentrated cheese whey were used as the sources of carbon in a microbial fuel cell. The power densities of 188.8 and 288.12 mW m(-2) were recorded for whey-fed and concentrated whey-fed MFCs while the COD removal were 95% and 86% respectively. Biological wastewater treatment can be a very efficient alternative for traditional wastewater treatment which selecting any and or integrating of them depends on specific applications needed to be achieved.

The momentum of current research in this area is focused on optimizing the potential benefits in transportation sector through introduction of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). However the rapid adoption of critical cleaner energy system is still problematic in developing countries especially in transportation. This article sheds light on the Malaysian case by highlighting related issues and obstacles, and discusses the future prospects of hydrogen FCV. We argue that innovation and technological advancement of hydrogen FCV is important and ready for introduction in Malaysia; however it is not sufficient in explaining the conditions that will allow for rapid transition in Malaysia. The main message of this article is that hydrogen FCV in Malaysia can be expected and is possible when there is a thorough understanding of energy security issues, where energy policy integration for economic development and environmental objectives are achieved at the same time. The understanding of specific problems from the standpoint of developing country is crucial in encouraging government policies to induce development of hydrogen FCV.

Reducing the operation temperature into intermediate temperature-to-low temperature (IT-LT) zones may lead to a mismatch in the thermal expansion coefficient between the cathodes and the developed IT-LTSOFC electrolyte materials. Hence, cathode materials are adjusted to resolve this issue. Studies on IT-LTSOFC propose cobalt-free cathodes as an alternative way to produce high electro-chemical performance cells for operation within the IT-LT range. Novel cobalt-free cathode powders are developed using perovskite structured materials, such as strontium ferrite oxide, as the main components together with dopants.

The aim of this work is to examine carbon formation on the Ni-SDC anode when feeding with CO under conditions when carbon deposition is thermodynamically favoured. Electrochemical tests were conducted at intermediate temperatures (550-700 degrees C) using 20 and 40% CO concentrations. Cell operating with 40% CO at 600-700 degrees C provided maximum power densities of 239-270 mW cm(-2), 1.5 times smaller than that achieved with humidified H-2. Much lower maximum power densities were attained with 20% CO (50-88 mW cm(-2)). Some degradation was observed during the 6 h galvanostatic operation at 0.1 A cm(-2) with 40% CO fuel at 550 degrees C which is believed due to the accumulation of carbon at the anode. The degradation in cell potential occurred at a rate of 4.5 mV h(-2), but it did not lead to cell collapse. EDX mapping at the cross-section of the anode revealed that carbon formed in the Ni-SDC cell was primarily deposited in the anode section close to the fuel entry point. Carbon was not detected at the electrolyte-anode interface and the middle of the anode, allowing the cell to continue operation with CO fuel without a catastrophic failure.

However, a high sintering temperature of up to 1550 degrees C is typically required to produce dense CGO electrolyte, eventually leading to an interfacial interdiffusion between the electrolyte and electrode components as well as generate a highly resistive interface which reduces ionic conductivity. Lowering the sintering temperature of the electrolyte will greatly benefit the fabrication of SOFCs. This study examines the effectiveness of introducing nano size CGO particles as an approach to get dense CGO electrolyte at lower sintering temperature. A series of dope suspensions with 0-50% nano size loading were prepared to observe rheology and measure viscosity. Then, 30% loading was selected and casting into flat sheet via phase-inversion technique. The flat sheet was characterized by morphology, surface roughness and mechanical strength tests. The suspension was extruded into dual-layer hollow fiber (DLHF) as well. The electrolyte/anode dual-layer hollow fibers (DLHFs) half-cell of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (MTSOFCs) were prepared via phase inversion based co-extrusion/co-sintering technique. The developed half-cell was characterized by morphological and gas tightness tests which further compared them with fully micron ones. The results show that the incorporation of 30% nanoparticle yielded to dense and tight CGO layers sintered at temperature 1450 degrees C, which about 50 degrees C lower than those reported previously for 100% micron particles. The I V measurements demonstrated the maximum power density of 0.66 Wcm(-2) at temperatures 500 degrees C using 100% H-2 as fuel. Therefore, this approach is able to reduce the energy cost for the microstructural control of the prepared fiber and thus is recommended for the fabrication of low-cost dual-layer hollow fiber micro tubular SOFCs.

To date, promising candidates for metallic interconnects are all Cr-containing alloys, which are susceptible to volatile Cr migration that causes cell degradation.

The development of this highly robust SOFC which operates on a variety of fuels however, requires improvements on the electrodes, where nanoscale engineering is required in order to maximize the number of sites where the electrochemical reactions take place. In this article, we briefly explained the growth of GaAs nanowires on a GaAs substrate as an electrode using metal organic chemical organic vapor deposition (MOCVD). Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) analysis were carried out as to investigate the structural properties and current voltage changes in the wires. Results show that nanowires grown are less defect, uniform in composition and with optimum desired diameters. The current voltage measurement showed it is similar to that of a p n junction characteristic which is suitable for the SOFC operation. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this study, three types of carbon based materials were used to fabricate anode diffusion layers - carbon black Vulcan (R) (CBV), M-15 grade graphene nanosheets (GM-15) and C-500 grade graphene nanosheets (GC-500). The microporous layers of cathodes were constructed with CBV. A carbon-based microporous layer with a 2 mg cm(-2) loading was coated onto a PTFE-pretreated carbon cloth, while a Nafion-117 membrane was applied as the electrolyte to the DMFCs. Pt-Ru black and Pt black were used as anode and cathode electrode catalysts, each with loadings of 8 mg cm(-2) and 4 mg cm(-2), respectively. All tests were conducted using MEAs with active areas of 4 cm(2) and air was supplied to single cells by passive modes. Surface morphology was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which produced pictures of complex network formations within the structures. CBV consists of nanosized carbon particles, while both GM-15 and GC-500 are made of stacks of graphene sheets with flaky structures that increase catalyst utilization. Performance tests of the DMFCs were conducted using a potentiostat that generated polarization curves. The highest peak power density of 13.7 mW cm(-2) was obtained by the GC-500 anode diffusion layer using 3 M methanol as fuel. The energy efficiency of the passive DMFCs was approximately 10% with a specific energy of approximately 610 Wh kg(-1), which is higher than that of conventional lithium ion batteries, portraying the bright future of alternative energy sources for use in power applications for portable devices. The high power densities obtained by both graphenebased materials, GM-15 and GC-500, demonstrate that graphene is a material other than state of the art carbon black that has the potential to be used as a DMFC anode support material.

The 1Yb10ScSZ materials were prepared by precipitation (P-YbScSZ) and sol gel (SG-YbScSZ) using L-arginine as the basic amino acid. L-Arginine can form complex gel with metal cation and increase the solution pH. The calcination temperatures were varied from 600 to 700 degrees C to study the effect of calcination temperature on particle size. The stable cubic phase ensured the high ionic conductivity of the zirconia-based electrolyte material for solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC). The crystal structures of the nanoparticles obtained from the precipitation and sol-gel methods were cubic, but the nanoparticles obtained from the precipitation method calcined at 600 degrees C were more uniformly sized. However, the symmetrical cell with SG-YbScSZ powder sintered at 1550 degrees C/5 h showed a higher ionic conductivity value of 0.012 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C and a lower activation energy than the cell using the P-YbScSZ powder. This finding demonstrated that the 1Yb10ScSZ electrolyte prepared by the sol gel method had better properties, higher sinter ability, and ability to obtain sufficient density with better electrical property than that prepared by the precipitation method.

The preparation procedure involved three steps: i) Irradiation of ETFE films by an electron beam (EB) accelerator, ii) copolymerization of 1-Vlm-co-1-V-2-P onto the EB-preirradiated ETFE films under selected conditions and iii) acid doping of the grafted ETFE films with PA. The physiochemical properties of the resulted membranes were analysed in terms of degree of grafting (DG), grafting compositions, ionic conductivity, thermal properties and thermal stability using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) fitted with attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. The results showed that the physiochemical properties of the membranes are comparable to Nafion 117 especially their thermal stability. At 120 degrees C and 0% relative humidity the membrane remained stable at 76% DG and 7.6 mmol repeat polymer unit(-1) with ionic conductivity of 53 mS cm(-1). Overall the characterization tests indicated that the membrane displayed impressive thermos-chemical and physical properties with less water dependency. At 200 degrees C the membrane remained thermally stable which enhances the membranes potential application in high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) operating at 100 degrees C and above. Grafting kinetics of nitrogenous and heterocyclic 1-Vim-co-1-V-2-P onto EB-preirradiated ETFE films were, also investigated in conjunction with reaction parameters namely: monomer concentration (M), reaction temperature (RT), and absorbed dose (D). This was achieved by the determination of three kinetic parameters namely: the initial polymerization rate (r(p0)), characteristics radical recombination rate (gamma) and delay time (t(0)) respectively. The variation of r(p0) with D and M allows the determination of the order of dependence of grafting rate (R-g) on D and M which are 2.23 and 3.39 respectively. Activation energy (E-a) was also determined followed by temperature effect investigation in the range of 50-70 degrees C. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of grafting parameters such as TAC concentration, absorbed dose and monomer concentration on the degree of grafting was investigated. The properties of the obtained membranes such as chemical composition, thermal stability and mechanical properties were evaluated using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and universal mechanical tester, respectively. The proton conductivity of the membranes was investigated in correlation with TAC content and temperature using the impedance spectroscopy. Of all samples, the crosslinked membrane obtained from grafting a mixture of 4-VP with 5 vol% TAC having a DG of 65% exhibited proton conductivity as high as 39 mS/cm under dry condition at 120 degrees C.

Even though hydrogen is emission free in its end use; the production of hydrogen itself requires energy and may cause process emissions including fugitive emissions from various sources, mainly the piping equipment and fittings. The emissions, even though not as large as stack emissions, they may still pose risks to the environment and health especially to the workers within the plant area. This paper presents the estimation of fugitive emissions from hydrogen production process via natural gas steam reforming. Firstly, the natural gas steam reforming process was simulated before the fugitive emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the process were estimated. Then, the consequent global warming potential (GWP) and the associated health risks due to the emissions were evaluated. A comparison of the GHG fugitive emissions with other sources of GHG emissions over the hydrogen production life cycle was also performed. Methane (CH4) recorded the highest rate of fugitive emissions contributing to the greatest GWP. On the other hand, CO2 represented the total stack emissions contributing to 100% of the total GWP. The concentrations of the gases emitted as fugitive emissions (CH4, CO2 and CO) in the process area are below the threshold exposure limit indicating that the plant environment is safe for workers daily exposures to the emitted gases.

The results showed that the most promising electrolyte layer with thin, dense, gastight, and defect-free properties was obtained by mixing 70% submicron-YSZ and 30% nano-YSZ in electrolyte suspension (E-0.7sub0.3nano). This electrolyte formulation co-extruded with a thick nickel-oxide-YSZ (NiO-YSZ) anode layer yielded the highest bending strength of 85 MPa, providing major mechanical strength to the HF. Besides that, the nitrogen permeability value at 2.87 x 10(-6) mol m(-2) S-1 Pa-1 suggested that the electrolyte was gas-tight, preventing fuel and oxidant transport. The fiber was then reduced to nickel (Ni)-cermet anode. It was developed to be a complete micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SOFC) by depositing the lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF)/YSZ cathode via brush painting on the dual-layer HF. The cell was fed with hydrogen gas and yielded an open-circuit voltage (OCV) as high as 1.06 V with maximum power density of 0.243 W cm(2), at 875 degrees C. Based on this test, it was found that the electrolyte structural-modified dual-layer hollow fiber-based MT-SOFC using mixed particle sizes may result in a promising OCV. However, the relatively low value for power density may be due to a less porous anode; thus, improvements in the anode's structure are required in future research.

The PEMFC offers clean and environmentally friendly usage in electrical power systems. The bipolar plates contribute 60%-80% of the total components of PEMFC stack with electrical conductivity >100 S cm(-1). Therefore, high conductivity and corrosion resistance are observed for long-term operations in PEMFC. Recent works has developed the cost-effective and feasible alternative materials to replace graphite bipolar plates. Metallic materials, such as SS and titanium, possess good electrical conductivity but poor corrosion resistance. Coating of SS and titanium bipolar plates can improve the corrosion resistance of metallic bipolar plates. Excellent performance of bipolar plates was recorded by using NbC coating for stainless steel materials. The ICR value using plasma surface alloying method was 8.47 m Omega cm(2) with a low current density (Icon.) between 0.051 and 0.058 A cm(-2). The criteria for both current densities (<1 mu A cm(-2)) and electrical conductivity (<10 m Omega cm(2)) met the DOE's 2020 technical targets. In addition, conventional air brush method can be used for fabricating multilayer coatings onto substrates because it is self-cleaning, low cost and offers high volume and large area production. Vapor deposition method, a highly advanced coating technology using PVD, suitable for coating bipolar plates because it is environmentally friendly and can be used in high temperatures, producing materials with good impact strength and excellent abrasion resistance. PEMFC cost is still too high for large scale commercialization, which is the cost of raw material and processing to allow fabrication of thinner plates contributes substantially to the total PEMFC cost. Some future works on fuel cell anticorrosion research with reasonable coating method is suggested to reduce the cost in order to facilitate the move toward commercialization especially for SS and titanium bipolar plates.

These flow fields are important because they isolate and enhance the diffusion of the reactant for the electrochemical reaction. The flow fields on these plates are pathways that both supply reactant and remove reaction products from the anode and cathode of a PEMFC. Fluid flow in these flow fields can greatly affect the performance and life span of the device. In this study, conventional and modified parallel flow field designs were analyzed using computational fluid dynamic modeling. The designs split flow into variant channel widths to facilitate even reactant distribution. Flow characteristics are presented, including the pressure and velocity variations in the flow channels across the flow field and comparison of the pressure-drop characteristics of different flow fields. The results show that multiple stages of flow distribution can achieve an evenly distributed pressure drop with an ideal distribution of reactant among channels.

The development of the models has been shown to be important for predicting the electrical properties of the CPCs. The main challenge is to produce a constant electric supply in the fuel cell systems which influence the overall fuel cell performance. Generally, the classical percolation theory describes that the electrical conductivity of the polymer composite is achieved when the volume fraction of the conductive filler is above the specific value, known as percolation threshold phenomena. Current research trends using the General Effective Media (GEM) model show it is the best model to predict the electrical properties of the composite. The main advantage of using the GEM is the model can predict the electrical conductivity for multiple filler systems at high filler loadings. Numerous factors including volume fraction, shape and size, aspect ratio, critical value, and orientation are significant in developing a robust model. Controlling the filler orientations in the CPCs are important as they are able to improve the mechanical performance while enhancing the electrical conductivity of the composite. Orientation can be induced by a few methods such as shear stress, altering die and fillers aspect ratio based on the needs. By controlling the fillers direction, one is able to control both the mechanical and electrical conductivity of the CPCs. However, recent publications seem to suggest that the Fibre Contact Model (FCM) is the latest model that considers the orientation factor in predicting conductivity. A good agreement between experimental results and modelling prediction can be observed using carbon-fibre reinforced polypropylene below and above the percolation threshold. Parallel orientations of the fibres to the extrusion die direction provided better electrical conductivity compared to randomly oriented fillers. This manuscript attempts to discuss other potential models used in predicting the electrical conductivity of the CPCs. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Development of microalgal biofuels from microalgae does not satisfy the economic feasibility of overwhelming capital investments and operations. Hence, high-value co-products have been produced through the extraction of a fraction of algae to improve the economics of a microalgae biorefinery. Examples of these high-value products are pigments, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins and anti-oxidants, with applications in cosmetics, nutritional and pharmaceuticals industries. To promote the sustainability of this process, an innovative microalgae biorefinery structure is implemented through the production of multiple products in the form of high value products and biofuel.

The pure perovskite LSCF cathode powder was synthesized through glycine nitrate process (GNP) using microwave heating technique. Compared with conventional heating technique, microwave heating allows the rapid combustion to occur simultaneously between the nitrates and glycine in a controllable manner. The resulting powder is a single-phase nanocrystallite with a mean particle size of 113 nm and a high specific surface area of 12.2 m(2)/g, after calcination at 800 degrees C. Impedance analysis indicates that microwave heating has significantly reduced the polarization resistance of LSCF cathode. The area specific resistance (ASR) value of 0.059 and 0.09712 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C and 750 degrees C, respectively, were observed.

The main obstacle for biodiesel production from marine microalgae is the high cost due to many downstream stages involved such as harvesting, dewatering, drying, extraction, separation and transesterification processes. In order to address these issues, the one step process is introduced where lipids are directly extracted and transesterified from wet biomass and processed using simultaneous cooling and microwave heating transesterification (SCMH) which is a green technology since microwave heating consumes only one third of the conventional heating energy and the cooling effect promotes more microwave penetration to the reaction mixture. This one step biodiesel production via SCMH was then benchmarked against the conventional one step process using the water bath heating and microwave assisted transesterification. The results revealed one step SCMH produced higher biodiesel production (75%) than water bath (13.46%) and microwave method (1539%). The biodiesel production via SCMH was almost 5 times higher than the other methods. Biodiesel properties and cell disruption produced from SCMH method were also better than the other two methods.

This work shows that such agglomeration can be inhibited by alloying Co into Pd. PdO, Pd0.95Co0.05O, Pd0.90Co0.10O, and Pd0.80Co0.20O were synthesized and characterized. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns at 750 and 900 degrees C confirmed that PdO decomposition to Pd which normally occurred at 840 degrees C was suppressed for Co containing Pd alloys while thermal gravimetric analyses indicated improved redox reversibility of PdO <-> Pd conversion for alloys during the thermal cycling between 600 and 900 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy images supported these arguments. Pd0.90Co0.10+yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrode (i.e., 10 mol % Co containing PdO-impregnated YSZ electrode) displayed the highest oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance and stability. The polarization resistance for ORR on Pd0.90Co0.10+YSZ cathode is only 0.088 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C. During polarization test at 750 degrees C, Pd0.90Co0.10+YSZ cathode showed stable performance for 30 h while the performance of Pd+YSZ cathode degraded after 10 h.

The electrons and protons generated from microbial organic oxidation at the anode which were utilized for electrochemical azo dye reduction at the cathodic chamber was successfully demonstrated. When NC was employed as the electron acceptor, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and dye decolourisation efficiencies obtained at the anodic and cathodic chamber were 73 +/- 3% and 95.1 +/- 1.1%, respectively. This study demonstrated that the decolourisation rates of monoazo dyes were similar to 50% higher than diazo dyes. The maximum power density in relation to NC decolourisation was 20.64 mW/m(2), corresponding to current density of 120.24 mA/m(2). The decolourisation rate and power output of different azo dyes were in the order of NC >AO7 > RR120 > RG19. The findings revealed that the structure of dye influenced the decolourisation and power performance of MFC. Azo dye with electron-withdrawing group at para sub-stituent to azo bond would draw electrons from azo bond; hence the azo dye became more electrophilic and more favourable for dye reduction.

CaTiO3 offers unique characteristics, such as non-radioactive and non-magnetic orthorhombic biaxial structure with bulk density of 3.91 g/cm(3). CaTiO3 film deposition on the solar cell substrate has been carried out using Radio Frequency (RF) magnetron sputter coating technique under varying time durations (10 min to 45 min). Morphological studies proved the formation of CaTiO3 layer and respective elemental percentages on the coated substrate. Open circuit voltage studies were conducted on bare and coated silicon solar substrates under open and controlled atmospheric conditions.

Nevertheless, slow kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the surface of graphite often results in poor performance of MFC. In an attempt to improve the performance of MFC for in-situ H2O2 production, a treatment of graphite cathode using nitric acid was performed. The treatment was conducted in three steps (i) heat treatment at 4508C for 2 h; (ii) acid treatment with concentrated nitric acid for 5 h; and (iii) drying at 120 degrees C for 2 h. After the treatment, four times increase in surface area of treated cathode (GR-HA) was observed. Energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis revealed the presence of nitrogen and quinone based functional groups on the surface of GRHA. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis of GR-HA cathode further confirmed the production of H2O2 at the peak current value of 23.7 mA and on-set potential of 20.1 V. Following CV analysis, H2O2 production experiments were performed in a dual chamber MFC using GR-HA as cathode. Maximum 150 mg/L of H2O2 was produced with simultaneous power production of 36.438 mW/m(2). Approximately, 25% increase in both H2O2 and power production was observed in the case of G cathode. Subsequently, Fenton oxidation experiments were performed (with GR-HA and GR-CA cathodes) to determine the efficacy of in-situ produced H2O2. This resulted in an increase of 8.28%, 11.04%, and 31.32% in decolorization, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) removal efficiency, respectively.

These NPs supported on carbon black were applied as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. The UFHA-modified Pt NP catalyst showed high electrocatalytic activity and durability compared to a commercial catalyst. Besides suppression of undesired oxide formation on the Pt surface, the affinity between the perfluorinated alkyl chains of UFHA and Nafion((R)) improved the catalyst activity by creating a desirable proton conduction path. Additionally, UFHA modification improved durability by suppressing Pt dissolution and carbon corrosion because of restricted water accessibility.

The nanocomposite membrane was soaked in the Fenton reagent solution with 0.8-50 ppm iron salts concentration for up to 96 h. The results indicate that presence of Cloisite (R) inorganic particles can improve the stability of SP/CL/TAP nanocomposite membrane against the radical attack. FF-IR characterization combined with DFT study has shown that C-O-C and -SO3H bonding with phenylene ring, and hydrogen bonding between SPEEK, Cloisite (R), and TAP are vulnerable to the radical attack. Loss of these functional groups has caused structural deformation, deterioration of mechanical strength, and changes of hydrophilicity in the SP/CL/TAP nanocomposite membrane. Additionally, changes in its chemical structure have caused its water uptake, proton conductivity, and methanol barrier properties to drop, up to 2 x higher than the Nafion (R) 117 membrane. However, the selectivity value of the SP/CL/TAP nanocomposite membrane (27,037 S.s/cm(3)) remains higher than the Nafion (R) 117 membrane (3292 S.s/cm(3)) due to its lower methanol permeability value (2.72 x 10(-7) cm(2)/s) as compared to Nafion (R) 117 membrane (2.95 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s). Based on the correlation graph, the SP/CL/TAP nanocomposite membrane could operate as PEM in the DMFC system up to 9800 h. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the SP/CL/TAP nanocomposite membrane has good stability in DMFC harsh environment and suitable to be employed as PEM for high-performance and long lifespan DMFC system.

Ethanol inhibited its own production at a concentration of >20 g L-1. Ethanol productivity was enhanced by continuous in situ extraction with water immiscible organic solvents. Several solvents were evaluated for biocompatibility with Z. mobilis and the ability to extract ethanol from a batch fermentation. In situ batch extractive fermentations were carried out in a 2-L stirred bioreactor (1:1 volume ratio of solvent and fermentation broth) with an optimal glucose concentration of 150 g L-1, 35 degrees C, and an agitation speed of 150 rpm. Oleyl alcohol, iso-octadecanol and 2-octyl-1-dodecanol were the three solvents that were most compatible with Z. mobilis. With these solvents, the cell viability relative to control (no solvent) was 1.48 +/- 0.40, 1.03 +/- 0.18 and 1.05 +/- 0.07, respectively, after two days of exposure. All solvents tested improved the final biomass concentration, the glucose consumption and ethanol production relative to control, but iso-octadecanol was clearly the most effective solvent. Using iso-octadecanol, the maximum ethanol concentration of 75 3 g L-1 was attained. This was nearly 1.25-fold that of the control fermentation. For this solvent, the ethanol yield on glucose was 0.485 +/- 0.005 gg(-1) compared to a yield of 0.468 +/- 0.005 gg(-1) for the control culture. (C) 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Despite its very stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance over large number of cycles, layered double perovskite PrBaCo2O5+ (PBC) has a rather limited surface area. It is, thus, desirable to have the stability of PBC combined with the higher OER activity obtained by enlarging its surface area. Here, we used micro-sized PBC particles as the substrate for the deposition of nano-sized nickel-iron hydroxide, Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH)(2), which led to an order of magnitude improvement in the OER current density at 1.63V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode for the amorphous Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH)(2)-decorated PBC catalyst (A-Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH)(2)+PBC), relative to the PBC catalyst. We showed that the crystal ordering of the decoration affects the OER activity, that is, the amorphous decoration provided a higher OER activity than the crystalline decoration by enabling a larger contact area between the catalyst and the aqueous electrolyte. The results we show here could potentially stimulate more innovative future works utilising simple chemical preparation route to realise high-performance hybrid OER catalysts involving novel constituents.","[Liang, Fengli; Mao, Junkui; Yang, Ziqiong] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Energy & Power Engn, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Aerosp Power Syst, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China; [Sunarso, Jaka] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Kuching 93350, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Zhou, Wei] Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem Engn, Jiangsu Natl Synerget Innovat Ctr Adv Mat SI CAM, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China","Liang, FL (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Energy & Power Engn, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Aerosp Power Syst, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China.; Zhou, W (corresponding author), Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Chem Engn, Jiangsu Natl Synerget Innovat Ctr Adv Mat SI CAM, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China.",fengli0912@nuaa.edu.cn; wei.zhou@uq.edu.au,", 周嵬/B-1083-2012; Sunarso, Jaka/B-9077-2008; Liang, Fengli/C-5691-2012",", 周嵬/0000-0003-0322-095X; Sunarso, Jaka/0000-0002-5234-7431; ",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51502138]; Youth Fund in Jiangsu Province [BK20150738]; Open Fund of Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Materials and Technology for Energy Conversion [NJ20160033],"This work was enabled by financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51502138), the Youth Fund in Jiangsu Province (BK20150738), and the Open Fund of Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Materials and Technology for Energy Conversion No. NJ20160033.",,51,8,8,1,48,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",2196-0216,,,CHEMELECTROCHEM,ChemElectroChem,MAR,2017,4,3,,,,,550,556,,10.1002/celc.201600718,,,7,Electrochemistry,Electrochemistry,EP6FL,WOS:000397473700016,,,,,1/2/2021,

However, the prerequisite to realize these potentials is their stability in the presence of acid gases of CO2 and reducing atmosphere containing H-2 and CH4. This work seeks to validate the applicability of robust triple layer hollow fiber membranes consisting of (Ag+YSZ)/YSZ/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM)+YSZ to separate O-2 from air in the presence of these unavoidable gases for more advanced applications. To prepare the triple layer hollow fiber, the dual-layer fiber was firstly synthesized via a combined phase inversion and sintering method where the dense YSZ layer was present on top of the porous LSM-YSZ layer. We further deposited either porous Ag or its mixture with YSZ layer above the dense YSZ surface. The final fiber consists of three layers in sequence from outside surface to inside surface of Ag+YSZ/YSZ/LSM+YSZ. The dense central YSZ layer acts as the ionic conducting phase to prevent gas diffusion while the other two porous layers serve as the electronic conducting phase with catalytic effect to enhance the surface reaction kinetics. To overcome the electronic conductivity limitation of YSZ, silver (Ag) short circuit paste was additionally used to seal the membrane and electronically connect the outer and inner surfaces for electron shuttle for the two surface O-2 exchange reactions. Ag-YSZ coated fiber performed better than Ag coated fiber and showed increasing fluxes from 0.1 to 0.53 mL min(-1) cm(-2) upon increasing temperature from 700 to 900 degrees C. The O-2 fluxes remained constant irrespective of changing the sweep gas from pure He to its mixtures containing CO2, H-2, or CH4; mirroring the membrane robustness to tolerate these gases at high temperatures.","[Meng, Xiuxia; Jin, Yun; Bi, Xiuxiu; Yang, Naitao] Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Chem Engn, Zibo 255049, Peoples R China; [Sunarso, Jaka] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Jalan Simpang Tiga, Kuching 93350, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Tan, Xiaoyao] Tianjin Polytech Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaobin; Liu, Shaomin] Curtin Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Perth, WA 6102, Australia","Yang, NT (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Chem Engn, Zibo 255049, Peoples R China.; Liu, SM (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Perth, WA 6102, Australia.",naitaoyang@126.com; shaomin.liu@curtin.edu.au,"Liu, shaomin/E-3669-2010; Tan, Xiaoyao/C-9411-2019; Sunarso, Jaka/B-9077-2008; Wang, Shaobin/C-5507-2008; Wang, Shaobin/AAL-9581-2020","Liu, shaomin/0000-0001-5019-5182; Tan, Xiaoyao/0000-0002-2704-8018; Sunarso, Jaka/0000-0002-5234-7431; Wang, Shaobin/0000-0002-1751-9162; Wang, Shaobin/0000-0002-1751-9162","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21376143, 21476131]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2014BM010]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FT12100178]","The authors gratefully acknowledge the research funding provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21376143 and 21476131), and the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2014BM010).

Reductions in the electronbeam absorbed dose and amount of expensive, potentially hazardous VBC were achieved by using water as a diluent (reduced to 30-40 kGy absorbed dose and 5 vol% VBC) instead of the prior state-of-the-art method that used organic propan-2-ol diluent (required 70 kGy dose and 20 vol% VBC monomer). Furthermore, the water from the aqueous grafting mixture was easily separated from the residual monomer (after cooling) and was reused for a further grafting reaction: the resulting AEM exhibited an ion-exchange capacity of 2.1 mmol g 1 (cf. 2.1 mmol g (1) for the AEM made using a fresh grafting mixture). The lower irradiation doses resulted in mechanically stronger RG-AEMs compared to the reference RG-AEM synthesised using the prior state-of-the-art method. A further positive off-shoot of the optimisation process was the discovery that using water as a diluent resulted in an enhanced (i.e. more uniform) distribution of VBC grafts as proven by Raman microscopy and corroborated using EDX analysis: this led to enhancement in the Cl- anion-conductivities (up to 68 mS cm(-1) at 80 degrees C for the optimised fully hydrated RG-AEMs vs. 48 mS cm(-1) for the prior state-of-the-art RG-AEM reference). A down-selected RG-AEM with an ion-exchange capacity = 2.0 mmol g(-1), that was synthesised using the new greener protocol with a 30 kGy electron-beam absorbed dose, led to an exceptional beginning-of-life H-2/O-2 AEMFC peak power density of 1.16 W cm(-2) at 60 degrees C in a benchmark test using industrial standard Pt-based electrocatalysts and unpressurised gas supplies: this was higher than the 0.91 W cm(-1) obtained with the reference RG-AEM (IEC = 1.8 mmol g(-1)) synthesised using the prior state-of-the-art protocol.","[Wang, Lianqin; Magliocca, Emanuele; Cunningham, Emma L.; Mustain, William E.; Poynton, Simon D.; Escudero-Cid, Ricardo; Nasef, Mohamed M.; Ponce-Gonzalez, Julia; Bance-Souahli, Rachida; Slade, Robert C.

Schrad (fruit, seed and pulp) extracts as bio-fuels is reported. The structure, optical, and colloidal properties of the synthesized ZnO-NP samples were studied. Results illustrate that the morphology and particle size of the ZnO samples are different and depend on the bio-fuel. The XRD results revealed that hexagonal wurtzite ZnO-NPs with mean particle size of 27-85 nm were produced by different bio-fuels. The optical band gap was increased from 3.25 to 3.40 eV with the decreasing of particle size. FTIR results showed some differences in the surface structures of the as-synthesized ZnO-NP samples. This led to differences in the zeta potential, hydrodynamic size, and more significantly, antioxidant activity through scavenging of 1, 1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals. In in vitro cytotoxicity studies on 3T3 cells, a dose dependent toxicity with non-toxic effect of concentration below 0.26 mg/mL was shown for ZnO-NP samples. Furthermore, the as-synthesized ZnO-NPs inhibited the growth of medically significant pathogenic gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aurous) and gram-negative (Peseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) bacteria. This study provides a simple, green and efficient approach to produce ZnO nanoparticles for various applications.","[Azizi, Susan; Mohamad, Rosfarizan] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Dept Bioproc Technol, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Mohamad, Rosfarizan] Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Trop Forestry & Forest Prod, Lab Biopolymer & Derivat, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Shahri, Mahnaz Mahdavi] Islamic Azad Univ, Shiraz Branch, Dept Chem, Shiraz 7473171987, Iran","Azizi, S; Mohamad, R (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Dept Bioproc Technol, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.; Mohamad, R (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Trop Forestry & Forest Prod, Lab Biopolymer & Derivat, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",azisusan@gmail.com; farizan@upm.edu.my; mahnaz.chem@gmail.com,,"Mahdavi, Mahnaz/0000-0001-6992-1981; Mohamad, Rosfarizan/0000-0001-5672-1905; Azizi, Susan/0000-0002-3245-5427",,,,45,26,27,0,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1420-3049,,,MOLECULES,Molecules,FEB,2017,22,2,,,,,,,301,10.3390/molecules22020301,,,13,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,EM8HP,WOS:000395552400115,28212344,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,1/2/2021,

This study was conducted to investigate the potential of both the use of milled carbon fibre as a conductive filler in a composite and the adaption of the General Effective Media (GEM) model to predict the electrical conductivity of the polymer composite produced. Polymer composites with various loading concentrations of the conductive filler with epoxy (EP) resin were developed using the compression moulding technique. Incorporating carbon nano tube (CNT) and carbon black (CB) as secondary fillers on carbon fibre (CF) reinforces epoxy composites aided in increasing the electrical conductivity of the composites. The addition of small amounts of CNT and CB as secondary fillers in hybrid systems increased the through-plane conductivity to 40.3 S/cm and 19.9 S/cm, respectively. The high aspect ratio and small size of the CNT filled the gaps between CF as primary filler so that there was a more conductive path. These phenomena increased the electrical conductivity of the CNT/CF/EP composites to a level higher than that of the CB/CF/EP composites. The flexural strength of CF/EP also improved from 64.37 MPa to 80 MPa and 70 MPa by adding CNT and CB, respectively.

This study conducted a comprehensive investigation on combining the advantages of conventional batch and continuous operational modes in form of a simple and efficient looped configuration system, while reducing the drawbacks of each. In this regard, nine various recirculation batch (RB) systems with various recirculation to reactor volume ratios and with different recirculation flow rates were thoroughly evaluated and compared to the results of batch and continuous modes of operation. Recirculation rate and volume were both effective factors on system performance. The highest power density of 38 W/m(3) was achieved amongst the various studied RB systems, which showed 40% and 32% of improvement compared to batch and continuous systems respectively. Cyclic voltammetry test approved 3.6 and 2.1 times increment of oxidation peak in the optimised RB system compared to the batch and continuous systems respectively. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis showed the significant reduction of charge transfer resistance in RB system. Rather than high energy outputs, the proposed operational mode showed promising results on reducing the waste treatment duration by 12.5 and 3 times compared to the batch and continuous systems respectively while achieving the COD and pH close to the releasing requirements.

The conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was coated with varied concentrations onto graphite felt base anodes. The findings demonstrated that the optimum loading of 2.5 mg/cm(2) recorded maximum current density of 3.5 A/m(2) and coulombic efficiency of 51%. Higher loading of PEDOT enhanced the electrochemical characteristics of the anodes but exhibited unfavorable functionality. The charge transfer resistance of the modified anodes, R-a decreased significantly compared to the control anode after biofilm formation. The successful application of palm oil mill effluent (POME) wastewater as substrate indicates that the optimum anode was effective in degrading high organic wastewater. Exoelectrogens were found to be distributed mainly on the anodic biofilm.

To enhance the H-2-rich syngas production from residual biomass mixed with polymeric waste, a dual stage process involving catalytic steam gasification and tar cracking was integrated as a promising alternative technology for clean fuel production. Generally, the presence of tar causes syngas degradation and has been identified as one of the major impurities from the gasification process. This study shows the results obtained from an integrated process with optimization process conditions to enhance H-2-rich syngas yield. Nickel and dolomite were used as cheap and effective catalysts in fluidized and fixed bed gasifiers respectively, which resulted in high-quality syngas production with a maximum hydrogen yield of 284.1 g(H2) kg(feedstock)(-1) and carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) of 92.4 wt%. Furthermore, the study eventuates the upgrading of the bio-char to carbon nano-tubes (CNT).

Methane decomposition activity of n-Ni/SiO2 catalyst was quantified by considering thermodynamic deposition of carbon at a temperature range of 550-650 degrees C and methane partial pressure from 0.2 to 0.8 atm. The utmost methane conversion of 18.87 mmol/gcat min was obtained at 650 degrees C and methane partial pressure of 0.8 atm. The findings concluded that the enhancement occurred with carbon formation rate when increasing the methane partial pressure is very much evident at higher temperature such as 650 degrees C. However, the intensity in methane decomposition descending tendency was declined at lower reaction temperature. The effects of methane partial pressure and reaction temperature on the specific molar carbon formation rate were also examined. The calculated reaction order and activation energy were 1.40 and 61.1 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The kinetic experiments showed the existence of an optimum reaction condition to achieve the highest performance of n-Ni/SiO2 catalyst in terms of methane decomposition rate.

MFC was evaluated for production of bioelectricity with a simultaneous reduction in the carbon content. Using a surface response methodology with a Box-Behnken design (BBD), operating conditions such as the concentration of antifoam, pH, and resistance were optimized and it was found that the pH and resistance were optimum at 8.3 and 1000 0, respectively with no antifoam in the system. Under optimum conditions, 31.49 Wm-3 was generated, and 60.78 +/- 0.95% total organic carbon was degraded. We revealed that the fermentative bacteria generated organic acids mainly acetate from dextrose present in ADDW and electrogenic bacteria oxidized acetate in a successive manner to generate electrons, which was confirmed by gas chromatography. The development of biofilm analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) was found to be crucial in the transfer of electrons directly to the anode and was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry experiments. Identification of bacteria from biofilm by both culture and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis methods found bacteria belonging to phylum Firmicutes and gamma-proteobacteria. The study of successive nature of bacterial metabolism to generate electricity could play an important role in the production of electricity in a continuous mode of operation using MFCs fed with ADDW for further reduction of carbon content post anaerobic digestion for the benefit for the environment. Thus MFC can be used as a complementary technology to anaerobic digestion. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Scope of availability of hydrogen refuelling station from 100 MW (net power) OTEC plant could be determined. Advancement in OTEC technology could help in developing 2nd/3rd generation plants (using solar hybrid OTEC; Uehara cycle). The scope of by-product availability can make its electricity production cost much cheaper and would make a viable proposition in producing OTEC powered hydrogen.

However, the accumulation of dead cells over time within the anode biofilm can be particularly detrimental for current generation. In this study, the effect of ultrasound on anode biofilm thickness was investigated in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Ultrasonic treatment was employed for different durations to evaluate its ability to control the thickness of the biofilm to maintain stable power generation. Cell viability count and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis of the biofilms over time showed that the number of dead cells increased with the increase of biofilm thickness, and eventually exceeded the number of live cells by many-fold. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis indicated that the high polarization resistance appeared due to the dead layer formation, and thus the catalytic efficiency was reduced in MFCs. The stable power generation was achieved by employing ultrasonic treatment for 30 min every 6 days with some initial exception. The low frequency ultrasound treatment successfully dislodged the ineffective biofilm from the surface of the anode. Moreover, the ultrasound could increase the mass transfer rate of the nutrients and cellular waste through the biofilm leading to the increase in cell growth. Therefore, ultrasonic treatment is verified as an efficient method to control the thickness of the biofilm as well as enhance the cell viability in biofilm thereby maintaining the stable power generation in the MFC.","[Islam, M.

However, solar cell manufacturing cost (dollar/watt) is still substantially higher than fossil fuels. The route to lowering cost may not lie with continuing automation and economies of scale. Alternate fabrication processes with lower cost and environmental-sustainability coupled with self-reliance, simplicity, and affordability may lead to price compatibility with carbon-based fuels. In this paper, a customdesigned formulation of phosphoric acid has been investigated, for n-type doping in p-type substrates, as a function of concentration and drive-in temperature. For post-diffusion surface passivation and anti-reflection, thermally-grown oxide films in 50-150-nm thickness were grown. These fabrication methods facilitate process simplicity, reduced costs, and environmental sustainability by elimination of poisonous chemicals and toxic gases (POCl3, SiH4, NH3). Simultaneous fire-through contact formation process based on screen-printed front surface Ag and back surface through thermally grown oxide films was optimized as a function of the peak temperature in conveyor belt furnace. Highest efficiency solar cells fabricated exhibited efficiency of similar to 13%. Analysis of results based on internal quantum efficiency and minority carried measurements reveals three contributing factors: high front surface recombination, low minority carrier lifetime, and higher reflection. Solar cell simulations based on PC1D showed that, with improved passivation, lower reflection, and high lifetimes, efficiency can be enhanced to match with commercially-produced PECVD SiN-coated solar cells.

The influence of reduction on structure of the NiO-SDCC anode support for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was investigated. Raman spectra of the NiO-SDCC samples sintered at 500, 600 and 700 degrees C showed that after reducing at 550 degrees C NiO was reduced to Ni. In addition, SDC and carbonates (Li2CO3 and Na2CO3) did not undergo chemical transformation after reduction and were still detected in the samples. However, no Raman modes of carbonates were identified in the NiO-SDCC pellet sintered at 1000 degrees C and reduced at 550 degrees C. It is suspected that carbonates were decomposed at high sintering temperature and eliminated due to the reaction between the CO32- and hydrogen ions during reduction in humidified gases at 550 degrees C. The carbonate decomposition increased porosity in the Ni-SDCC pellets and consequently caused formation of brittle and fragile structure unappropriated for SOFC application. Because of that composite NiO-SDC samples without carbonates were also analysed to determine the factors affecting the crack formation. In addition, it was shown that the different reduction temperatures also influenced the microstructure and porosity of the pellets. Thus, it was observed that Ni-SDC pellet reduced at 800 degrees C has higher electrical conductivity of well-connected microstructures and sufficient porosity than the pellet reduced at 550 degrees C.","[Mahmud, Lily Siong; Muchtar, Andanastuti; Somalu, Mahendra Rao; Jais, Abdul Azim] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Muchtar, Andanastuti] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia","Mahmud, LS; Muchtar, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.; Muchtar, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",sionglily@gmail.com; muchtar@ukm.edu.my,"Muchtar, Andanastuti/E-3806-2017","Muchtar, Andanastuti/0000-0002-1599-8964; Somalu, Mahendra Rao/0000-0003-1667-693X; Jais, Abdul Azim/0000-0002-9128-6563","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM); Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, MalaysiaMinistry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia [03-01-02-SF1079, FRGS/2/2013/TK06/UKM/02/9]; Centre for Research and Instrumentation Management, UKM; Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education","This work was supported by the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Malaysia through research grants 03-01-02-SF1079 and FRGS/2/2013/TK06/UKM/02/9.

Many efforts have been made to improve the performance of battery such as high concentration of electrolyte, high power density of electrodes and high ion selective separator or membrane. The application of a biomass-derived as a separator have emerged as tantalising alternatives to liquid and synthetic polymer electrolyte for battery. The motivation is clear because of the corrosive, hazardous and leakage of liquid electrolyte usage; non-biodegradable and insolubility of synthetic polymer electrolyte in certain solvents. Due to environmental concern and sustainability, red seaweed-pulp is a good candidate to be used as a separator for battery. The SEM image revealed that morphology of red seaweed consists of 20-30% solid material (endofibre), which consists of small, regular and hollow fibre. These characteristics enable the pulp to absorb and retain the wettability of electrolyte and contribute high ion conductivity of battery. In this study, novel battery, a separator made from red seaweed-pulp, is comprised of aluminium plate (anode), graphite plate (cathode), and sodium chloride (electrolytes) that have been developed. This red seaweed pulp-based battery has shown a very good electrochemical potential from 2.5 to 3.0 V, maximum capacity up to 6 mAh, and the charge-discharge can withstand up to 10 cycles.

The aim of this study was to investigate the most commonly used variables employed for grid independency studies in a typical PEMFC and to find possibly the most effective variables that may be decisive in a PEMFC grid independence test. Herein, a three-dimensional (3-D), steady state, non-isothermal computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a serpentine channel proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) was developed. The present model includes various conservation equations that are dominant in a typical PEMFC: the mass, momentum, species, charge, and energy equations, which are coupled with the electrochemical model. The numerical results indicate that much more care should be taken while obtaining a mesh independence solution for CFD studies in PEMFC systems. Based on our findings in this study, it was demonstrated that employment of merely the polarization curve (current-voltage), especially only in a given specific point, was not sufficient to carry out the mesh independence tests for CFD studies in PEMFCs. In addition, it was observed that the average volumetric hydrogen concentration inside the catalyst layer on the anode side has a more significant role to check the grid independency tests.","[Esfeh, H.

To control the distribution and amount of nickel deposition on the Ag/GDC surfaces; first, a systematic cyclic voltammetry study of nickel electrodeposition from a Watts bath on silver foils was carried out to understand the influence of operating conditions on the electrodeposition process. From the cyclic voltammetry study, it can be concluded that suitable operating conditions for nickel electrodeposition into porous Ag/GDC scaffolds and catalytic membranes are: 1.1 M Ni2+ concentration in Watts bath; deposition potential between -0.65 to -1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl; a temperature at 55 degrees C; sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as the surfactant; pH 4.0 +/- 0.2 and an agitation rate of 500 rpm. It was observed that the nickel surface microstructure changed with the deposition current densities due to the co-evolution of H-2. Pulse and continuous electrodeposition modes allow nickel to be deposited throughout porous Ag/GDC scaffolds and onto catalytic membranes. The pulse electrodeposition mode is favored as this is shown to result in an even Ni distribution within the porous scaffolds at minimum H-2 pitting. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

The electrolyte (Ce0.8Sm0.1Ba0.1O2-delta) powder was synthesized using the citric acid-nitrate combustion method and calcined at 900 degrees C for 5 h. The calcined electrolyte exhibited a cubic fluorite crystal structure with some impurity phases. The calcined powder was then pressed into cylindrical pellets using uniaxial die-pressing. The pellets were sintered at three different temperatures, i.e., 1200, 1300 and 1400 degrees C for 5 h. Microstructural analysis of the pellets showed that the average grain size increased with the increase in sintering temperature. The sintered densities of the pellets were measured by Archimedes' method, and the relative density values were within the range of 78% TD to 87% TD as the sintering temperature increased from 1200 to 1400 degrees C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis showed that conductivity increased with the increase in sintering temperature, but no considerable change in conductivity was observed for the pellets sintered at 1300 and 1400 degrees C. The results revealed that the electrolyte pellet sintered at 1300 degrees C exhibited the ionic conductivity of 0.005 S/cm with lowest activation energy of 0.7275 eV.","[Anwar, Mustafa; Ali, Muhammed S.

The focus of this study was to provide a feasibility study on the potential of a local isolated Chlorella vulgaris strain for biodiesel production comprising of cell growth, biomass productivity and drying at various temperatures. The results showed that C. vulgaris which was cultured in pH 7 medium, under the light intensity of 2000 lux and 14/10 h photoperiod cycle, produced the highest number of cells and biomass. pH, light intensity and photoperiod had an individual influence on the cell growth. Drying at 60 degrees C was identified to be ideal since the lipid content decreased marginally while the lipid composition was retained, i. e. 36.45% of saturated and 60.05% of unsaturated fatty acid. The biodiesel synthesized in this study contained 16 to 18 carbon atoms (palmitic, stearic, oleic, palmitoleic, linoleic and linolenic acid) which were suitable elements in producing biodiesel. Furthermore, the biodiesel produced complied with the ASTM standards which establish this C. vulgaris strain as a potential source for biodiesel production.","[Rajanren, Jeevan Raj] Taylors Univ, Sch Engn, Environm Res Grp, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ismail, Harun Mohamed] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Engn, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia","Rajanren, JR (corresponding author), Taylors Univ, Sch Engn, Environm Res Grp, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia.",ijeevanraj@gmail.com,,,,,,67,1,2,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1759-7269,1759-7277,,BIOFUELS-UK,Biofuels-UK,,2017,8,1,,,,,37,47,,10.1080/17597269.2016.1200861,,,11,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,EO4ND,WOS:000396670700004,,,,,1/2/2021,

K. variicola was isolated from municipal wastewater (MWW) and identified using BIOLOG gene III analysis, PCR and sequencing. The performance of K. variicola in MFC was evaluated by polarization curve measurement, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis. The MFC with K. variicola achieved a maximum power density of about 1.7 W m(-3) which is comparatively higher than most widely used anaerobic sludge (215 mW m(-3)) as an inoculum whereas COD removal efficiency is (43%) lower than anaerobic sludge (74%). Moreover, K. variicola has the ability to produce electron shuttles and to form biofilms on the electrode surface which helps to significantly reduce the anode charge transfer (R-ct) resistance compared to the anaerobic sludge. These results revealed the potential of K. variicola to be used in MFC.","[Islam, M.

An immobilized ZnO/Zn fabricated by sonication and heat attachment method was applied as the photoanode and Pt/C plate was used as the cathode of the PFC in this study. Factors that affect the decolorization efficiency and electricity generation of the PFC such as different initial dye concentrations and pH were investigated. Results revealed that the degradation of Reactive Green 19 (RG19) was enhanced in a closed circuit PFC compared with that of a opened circuit PFC. Almost 100% decolorization could be achieved in 8 h when 250 mL of 30 mg L-1 of RG19 was treated in a PFC without any supporting electrolyte. The highest short circuit current of 0.0427 mA cm(-2) and maximum power density of 0.0102 mW cm(-2) was obtained by PFC using 30 mg L-1 of RG19.

The effects of the NaOH concentration and the TNT crystal structure on the performance for methanol oxidation were investigated to determine the best catalyst support for Pt-based catalysts. The results showed that TNTs produced with 10 M NaOH exhibited a length and a diameter of 550 and 70 nm, respectively; these TNTs showed the best nanotube structure and were further used as catalyst supports for a Pt-based catalyst in a direct methanol fuel cell. The synthesized TNT and Pt-based catalysts were analysed by FESEM, TEM, BET, EDX, XRD and FTIR. The electrochemical performance of the catalysts was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometric (CA) analysis to further understand the methanol oxidation in the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). Finally, the result proves that Pt-Ru/TNT-C catalyst shows high performance in methanol oxidation as the highest current density achieved at 3.3 mA/cm(2) (normalised by electrochemically active surface area) and high catalyst tolerance towards poisoning species was established.","[Abdullah, M.; Kamarudin, S.

Phase purity and crystallite size of the synthesized materials are ascertained by powder X-ray diffraction studies. Introduction of Pr3+ ions in the cerium lattice exhibited a lower crystallite size than the Nb5+, which exposes the probability to attain high oxide ion conductivity of Pr3+ doped cerium oxide. Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectra confirm the functional groups and formation of Pr3+ and Nb5+ ions in the cerium lattice. Absorbance spectra exhibit the charge-transfer transition from O2- (2p) to Ce4+ (4f) orbital in cerium oxide. Pr3+ and Nb5+ ions doped cerium lattice create the oxygen vacancies and favor the formation of Ce3+ from Ce4+. Valence band transition of Ce3+ ions from the 5d to 4f levels are examined by photoluminescence studies. The morphological features of Ce-Pr-O and Ce-Nb-O are investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is used to analyze the conductivity properties of solid electrolytes. Ce-Pr-O shows the high oxide ion conductivity of 0.1 S/cm at 600 A degrees C with an activation energy of 0.73 eV. Electrolytes with specific conductivities higher than 10(-2) S/cm at intermediate temperatures (400-600 A degrees C) are required for solid oxide fuel cells to operate with less maintenance. Hence, Ce-Pr-O can be a suitable electrolyte material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.","[Bhabu, K.

While hydrogen is a renewable and clean energy career, the safety aspects associated with it is still a key issue. Hydrogen has a wide flammability range and needs less energy to be ignited, compared to other common fuels. Experiments on hydrogen safety are not an economic and safe approach; hydrogen is a very dangerous substance, and expensive to test in a safe environment. Use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFDs) is an alternative method to predict the behaviour of hydrogen gas after an accidental release. Providing the concentration profile for the area of concern, and the ability to investigate different parameters such as ventilation, obstacles' configurations and ignition sources are the advantages of using CFDs codes for the safe design of hydrogen stations and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. In the current study, a CFD based approach is proposed to evaluate the dispersion behaviour of hydrogen gas after a release from a hydrogen fuel cell car in an enclosed area. The fuel concentration profile in the compartment is produced, considering different ventilation conditions. Mitigation measures are also applied to improve the ventilation condition and decrease the fuel concentration below the flammable level. The proposed approach is useful for better design of safety measures to prevent consequent accidents or minimise the harmful impacts during an accident.

With this in mind, the roles of dispersing agents were investigated for synthesizing a cathode material made of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-alpha (LSCF) for application in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs). In the present study, LSCF was synthesized following a sol-gel method with the aid of an activated carbon and ethylene glycol as dispersing agents. X-ray diffractometer measurements indicate that a single perovskite phase of LSCF started to develop at the temperature of 500 A degrees C and completely formed at 700 A degrees C. Scanning electron microscope analysis confirmed that a well dispersed LSCF powders were successfully synthesized achieving a surface area of 12.05 m(2) g(-1) as corroborated by the BET surface area analysis. This finding shows significant improvements of modifying the structural properties of cathode material and could be used to fabricate the next generation of SOFCs.","[Ismail, Ismariza] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Sci Appl, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia; [Osman, Nafisah; Jani, Abdul Mutalib Md] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Sci Appl, Bahagian HEA, STAR Kompleks, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia","Osman, N (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Sci Appl, Bahagian HEA, STAR Kompleks, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia.",fisha@perlis.uitm.edu.my,,"MOHD ISA @ OSMAN, PROFESOR MADYA DR NAFISAH/0000-0002-6303-8554","Ministry of Education (MOE) Malaysia [600-RMI/RACE 16/6/2, 600-RMI/FRGS 5/3]; Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP); MOEMinistry of Education, SingaporeMinistry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR); Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM)",This work was supported by Ministry of Education (MOE) Malaysia via Grant 600-RMI/RACE 16/6/2 (3/2012) and 600-RMI/FRGS 5/3 (8/2014).

The distribution of N-GQDs on the 3D MoS2-rGO framework was confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray elemental mapping, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy techniques. The resultant 3D nanohybrid was successfully demonstrated as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under alkaline conditions. The chemical interaction between the electroactive N-GQDs and MoS2-rGO and the increased surface area and pore size of the N-GQDs/MoS2-rGO nanohybrid synergistically improved the ORR onset potential to +0.81 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Moreover, the N-GQDs/MoS2-rGO nanohybrid showed better ORR stability for up to 3000 cycles with negligible deviation in the half-wave potential (E-1/2). Most importantly, the N-GQDs/MoS2-rGO nanohybrid exhibited a superior methanol tolerance ability even under a high concentration of methanol (3.0 M) in alkaline medium. Hence, the development of a low-cost metal-free graphene quantum dot-based 3D nanohybrid with high methanol tolerance may open up a novel strategy to design selective cathode electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cell applications.","[Vinoth, Ramalingam; Patil, Indrajit M.; Pandikumar, Alagarsamy; Kakade, Bhalchandra A.; Neppolian, Bernaurdshaw] SRM Univ, SRM Res Inst, Kancheepuram 603203, Tamil Nadu, India; [Huang, Nay Ming] Univ Malaya, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Low Dimens Mat Res Ctr, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Dionysios, Dionysiou D.] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Biomed Chem & Environm Engn, Environm Engn & Sci Program, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA","Neppolian, B (corresponding author), SRM Univ, SRM Res Inst, Kancheepuram 603203, Tamil Nadu, India.",neppolian.b@res.srmuniv.ac.in,"B, Neppolian/ABF-8484-2020; Alagarsamy, Pandikumar/AAG-4582-2019; Huang, NM/C-2423-2009","Alagarsamy, Pandikumar/0000-0002-8804-5195; Bernaurdshaw, Neppolian/0000-0002-7513-2812","Department of Science and Technology-Science and Engineering Research Board (DST-SERB), New Delhi, India [EMR/2014/000645]; Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), New Delhi, India [103/239/2015-NT]","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Department of Science and Technology-Science and Engineering Research Board (DST-SERB), New Delhi, India (File No: EMR/2014/000645) and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), New Delhi, India (File No: 103/239/2015-NT) for their financial support to carry out this research work.",,59,32,32,2,60,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2470-1343,,,ACS OMEGA,ACS Omega,NOV,2016,1,5,,,,,971,980,,10.1021/acsomega.6b00275,,,10,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry,EI7XZ,WOS:000392719300028,31457177,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,1/2/2021,

The porous Co3O4 nanorods were synthesized by a facile and cost-effective hydrothermal method. Three different concentrations (0.5 mg/cm(2), 1 mg/cm(2), and 2 mg/cm(2)) of Co3O4 nanorods coated on graphite electrodes were used to test its performance in MFCs. The results showed that the addition of porous Co3O4 nanorods enhanced the electrocatalytic activity and ORR kinetics significantly and the overall resistance of the system was greatly reduced. Moreover, the MFC with a higher concentration of the catalyst achieved a maximum power density of 503 +/- 16 mW/m(2), which was approximately five times higher than the bare graphite electrode. The improved catalytic activity of the cathodes could be due to the porous properties of Co3O4 nanorods that provided the higher number of active sites for oxygen. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

BET analysis reveals particles were of submicron size with porosity in the nanometer range. Bone-like apatite deposition ability of diopside scaffolds was examined under static and circulation mode of SBF (Simulated Body Fluid). It was noticed that diopside has the capability to deposit HAP (hydroxyapatite) within the early stages of immersion. ICP-OES analysis indicates release of Ca, Mg, Si ions and removal of P ions from the SBF, but in different quantities from diopside scaffolds. Cytocompatability studies on human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) revealed good cellular attachment on the surface of diopside scaffolds and formation of extracellular matrix (ECM).

Highly phosphonated and fully aromatic diamine monomer was prepared via three-step high-yielding procedure from previously synthesized phosphonated bisphenol: halogen displacement of 1-fluoro-4-nitrobenzene, reducing of nitro groups, and hydrolysis of phosphonate ester groups. A series of phosphonated copolyimide ionomers with ion exchange capacity (IEC) of 2.4-4.6 mequiv g(-1) were obtained by a typical polycondensation reaction followed by solution casting to form transparent and flexible membranes. Proton conductivity of the phosphonated membranes was comparable to that of the commercial per fluorinated ionomer at 100% RH. Typically, the conductivity value of up to 125 mS cm(-1) was obtained for the membrane with IEC of 3.5 mequiv g(-1) at 100 degrees C. However, by reducing the relative humidity the merits of phosphonated polyimides became more evidence and their dry state conductivity was 1-3 order of magnitudes higher than Naflon 115 and substantially higher than the values reported for phosphonated membranes. Thermogravimetric analysis and long-term proton conductivity study of phosphonated copolyimides at high temperatures (up to 160 degrees C) and low humidity confirmed small amount of undesired self-condensation of phosphonic acid groups compared with other phosphonated membranes.

Accordingly, 0.5,1, 3, and 5 wt% manganese were doped into yttria-stabilized zirconia and heated at temperatures ranging from 1300 degrees C to 1550 degrees C. The study revealed that the milling process reduced powder particle size from 0.54 mu m to 0.16 mu m. The grain size of the samples increased with increasing sintering temperature, and adding manganese dopants promoted further grain growth. When sintered at 1450 degrees C, 3 wt% manganese enhanced the densification of the sample to a relative density of 95.8% and Vickers hardness peaked at 14.4 GPa. The samples with manganese dopants exhibited fracture toughness values of 41-4.6 MPa . m(1/2) when sintered at temperatures above 1450 degrees C, regardless of dopant content.

The enhancement of cathode microstructure is one of the effective ways to improve the reaction rate. Pore former addition method is proven to be able to tailor the microstructure of cathode. The addition of polyether ether ketone (PEEK) as pore former was evaluated and compared with common pore formers (corn starch and graphite) for the microstructure cathode layer. Brush painting technique was used to deposit cathode layer on anode/electrolyte dual layer support hollow fiber. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis had proven that the resulting layer was free from impurities after the sintering treatment. Corn starch was able to induced cathode layer with coarse and large interconnected pores for efficient gas diffusion, as was proven by the SEM analysis. Additionally, SEM analysis also showed the formation of fine micropores throughout the layer when graphite was used as the pore former that can provide the increase in triple phase boundary region (TPB) in the layer. PEEK was able to generate both high porosity for oxygen diffusion to the reactive sites and increased number of TPB by the formation of fine microstructure pores in the cathode layer.","[Abd Mutalib, Muhazri; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan; Aziz, Madzlan; Rahman, Mukhlis A.; Jaafar, Juhana; Ismail, A.

Our research focused on understanding the chemical interactions of various catholytes having distinctive properties (oxidizing, buffering, and salinity) and their impacts on the electrochemical activities, bacterial growth and phenolic degradation in the MFC system. Our experimental results revealed that B. subtilis is a potential exoelectrogenic bacterium for producing current density of 64.0 mA/m(2) while degrading 2,4-dichlorophenol in the MFC. Chemical properties of the catholytes and the pH change profiles could have significant impact on the bio-electrochemical activities, therefore the performance of the MFC system. Potassium persulfate was found to be the most suitable catholyte for generating the maximal power density of 9.5 mW/m(2) with a peak current of 1.11 mA over a potential of 0.45 V, while degrading over 60% 2,4-dichlorophenol. The B. subtilis-catalysed MFC could be a feasible technology for removal of hazardous phenol pollutants from industrial wastewater, while generating electricity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Besides, unpredictable fluctuation of diesel prices in electricity generation is affecting the economy of a country. Thus, for developing country that's economically leans on the use of energy, renewable energy resources should be utilized to meet the increasing energy demand. In this regards, the cogeneration system using renewable energy sources is appropriate, because it has the advantage of producing both electrical power and heat energy from a single fuel. It is suitable for commercial clients like hospital buildings which requires to supply both electric and heat load. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the viability to develop a cogeneration system for a hospital building load in Malaysia. The proposed cogeneration system consists of grid connected photovoltaic (PV), fuel cell, and battery. Hybrid optimization model for electric renewable (HOMER) simulation software is used to perform the techno-economic analysis of the proposed system. The proposed system is then compared with other possible configurations. The economical comparison is based on the total net present cost (TNPC), levelized cost of energy (LCOE), renewable fraction, excess energy production and the pollutant gas emission of the system. The simulation result shows that, the proposed cogeneration system has the lowest TNPC, LCOE and operating cost which are $ 106,551, 0.091 $/kWh and 7245 $/yr respectively. Besides, the proposed cogeneration system is proven environmentally friendly as it only produces total 25,873 kg/yr of pollutant gas. The sensitivity analysis where fuel prices and annual interest rate are considered as sensitive parameters, shows impact on the TNPC and LCOE. Finally, the benefit from the Feed in Tariff (FiT) program provided by the government also has been presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

For an open cathode PEM fuel cell stack, the power output is constrained due to the use of air simultaneously as reactant and coolant. Optimal stack operation temperatures are not achieved especially at low to medium power outputs. Based on the ideal gas law, higher reactant temperatures would lead to higher pressures and subsequently improve the reaction kinetics. The hydrogen supply temperature and its pressure can be increased by preheating; thus, slightly offsetting the limitation of low operating stack temperatures. The exit air stream offers an internal source of waste heat for the hydrogen preheating purpose. In this study, a PEM open-cathode fuel cell was used to experimentally evaluate the performance of hydrogen preheating based on two waste heat recovery approaches: (1) open-loop and (2) closed loop hydrogen flow. The stack waste heat was channelled into a heat exchanger to preheat the hydrogen line before it is being supplied (open loop) or resupplied (closed loop) into the stack. At a constant 0.3 bar hydrogen supply pressure, the preheating increases the hydrogen temperature in the range of 2-13 degrees C which was dependant on the stack power output and cathode air flow rates. The achievable maximum stack power was increased by 8% for the closed loop and 10% for the open loop. Due to the small hydrogen flow rates, the waste heat utilization was only 3-6% from the generated stack heat. The analysis indicates a better potential for open loop hydrogen preheating using fuel cell waste heat for open-cathode stacks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Mohamed, W. A. N.

The composite membranes revealed enhanced proton conductivity in dry conditions compared with state-of-the-art pristine membrane (Nafion 112, N112). This was coupled with a low fuel crossover inheriting the composite membranes about 100 mV higher OCV than N112 when tested in PEMFC at 60 degrees C and 40% RH. A maximum power density of up to 930 mW cm(-2) was also achieved which is substantially higher than the N112 under similar conditions (577 mW cm(-2)). Such remarkable performance enhancement along with undetectable leaching of immobilized polyoxometalate, high dimensional stability and low water uptake of the composite membranes suggest a strong potential for PEMFC under low RH operation.

Knowing that the presence of water molecules in the diffusion process results in a lower energy barrier, we determined the diffusion barriers and corresponding tunneling probabilities of Nafion (R) 117 and SPEEK system using a simple theoretical model that excludes the medium (water molecules) in the initial calculations. We then propose an equation that relates the membrane conductivity to the tunneling probability. We recover the effect of the medium by introducing a correction term into the proposed equation, which takes into account the effect of the proton diffusion distance and the hydration level. We have also experimentally verified that the proposed equation correctly explain the difference in conductivity between Nafion (R) 117 and SPEEK.

In this work, we describe how a novel porous electrode scaffold, made from stainless steel 316L powder can be fabricated using selective laser sintering by proper selection of process parameters. Porosity, electrical conductivity and optical microscopy measurements were used to investigate the properties of fabricated samples. Our results show that a laser energy density between 1.50-2.00 J/mm(2) leads to a partial laser sintering mechanism where the powder particles are partially fused together, resulting in the fabrication of electrode scaffolds with 10% or higher porosity. The sample fabricated using 2.00 J/mm(2) energy density (60 W-1200 mm/s) exhibited a good electrical conductivity of 1.80 x 10(6) S/m with 15.61% of porosity. Moreover, we have observed the porosity changes across height for the sample fabricated at 60 W and 600 mm/s, 5.70% from base and increasing to 7.12% and 9.89% for each 2.5 mm height towards the top surface offering graded properties ideal for electrochemical devices, due to the changing thermal boundary conditions. These highly porous electrode scaffolds can be used as an electrode in electrochemical devices, potentially improving energy density and life cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

At high sintering temperature, more dense hollow fiber was formed while outer-layer extrusion rate affects the outer layer thickness.","[Mohamed, Mohd Hilmi; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan; Abd Mutalib, Muhazri; Rahman, Mukhlis; Jaafar, Juhana; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Fac Petr & Renewable Energy Engn, Utm Johor Bahru 81310, Malaysia; [Dzahir, Mohd Irfan Hatim Mohamed] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Bioproc Engn, Kompleks Pusat Pengajian Jejawi 3, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia","Othman, MHD (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Fac Petr & Renewable Energy Engn, Utm Johor Bahru 81310, Malaysia.",hafiz@petroleum.utm.my,"Jaafar, Juhana/J-8353-2012; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi/D-2643-2012; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan/J-8230-2015","Jaafar, Juhana/0000-0002-7245-8155; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi/0000-0003-0150-625X; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan/0000-0002-5842-2447; Mohamed Dzahir, Mohd Irfan Hatim/0000-0003-1509-8349",Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under the Exploratory Research Grant Scheme [R.J130000.7842.4L104]; Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [R.J130000.7809.4F282]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under Research University Grant Tier 1 [Q.J130000.2509.05H53],"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under the Exploratory Research Grant Scheme (Project Number: R.J130000.7842.4L104) and Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (Project Number: R.J130000.7809.4F282), and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under Research University Grant Tier 1 (Project number: Q.J130000.2509.05H53).

Silver-incorporated nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (Ag/N-rGO) has been synthesised through the simple annealing of metal salts with graphene oxide and melamine. The presence of silver and nitrogen atoms in Ag/N-rGO was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. Both the XPS and EDS results showed a higher Ag loading on the N-rGO surface compared with the rGO surface. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed a wide size distribution of Ag particles loaded on the N-rGO surface. Electrochemical results indicate that N-rGO is a better support for Ag than rGO. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results indicate that Ag/N-rGO is a potential ORR catalyst candidate in alkaline as it exhibited an onset potential of -0.15 V vs. Ag/AgCI and a limiting diffusion current density of -4.38 mA cm(-2) with four electron pathways. In addition, Ag/N-rGO also showed better methanol tolerance than Pt/C. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The sintering was carried out at temperatures 1300 degrees C and 1350 degrees C for 15 min using a 2.45 GHz microwave furnace. The sintering behavior of the microwave sintered ceramics was compared with that obtained via the conventional sintering at temperatures ranging from 1300 degrees C to 1550 degrees C with 2 h holding time. It was found that both sintering processes yielded highly dense samples with minimum density of 98% theoretical value. Phase analysis by X-ray diffraction revealed the presences of only cubic phase in all sintered samples. All sintered pellets possessed high Vickers hardness (13-14.6 GPa) and fracture toughness (similar to 3 MPa m(1/2)). Microstructural examination by using the scanning electron microscope showed that the grain size varied from 2.9 to 9.8 gm for the conventional sintered samples whereas the grain size of the microwave sintered ceramics was below 2 mu m. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy study recorded the maximum ionic conductivity of 0.280 S/cm at 800 degrees C for the conventional-sintered sample at 1550 degrees C whereas a high value of 0.314 S/cm was measured for the microwave-sintered sample at 1350 degrees C.

Three different Sr-deficient compositions, i.e., Sr1-xSc0.175Nb0.025Co0.8O3-delta (S1-xSNC, x=0.02, 0.05 and 0.1) including the non-deficient analogue, SSNC are prepared. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns indicate that the original cubic perovskite structure is retained. The thermal expansion coefficient between 50 degrees C and 900 degrees C increases progressively with increasing Sr deficiency, consistent with the beta-oxygen release profiles trend. The electrical conductivities for SSNC, S0.98SNC, S0.95SNC and S0.9SNC show a maximum-type profile against increasing temperature, i.e., semiconducting behavior followed by metallic behavior. Despite the consistent increase in the oxygen non-stoichiometry with increasing Sr deficiency, the oxygen reduction reaction performance increases in the order of SSNC, S0.9SNC, S0.98SNC and S0.95SNC. That the highest oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance is demonstrated by S0.95SNC indicates the trade-off between the increase in the concentration of oxygen vacancies and the formation of the phase impurities. At 650 degrees C, S0.95SNC shows an area specific resistance of 0.017 Omega cm(2) (from symmetric cell test) and a peak power density of 1263 mW cm(-2) (from single fuel cell test on a Ni-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) anode supported SDC electrolyte).

It represents a great opportunity for environmentally-friendly power generation using the energy of the sunlight. The efficiency of electricity generation in this novel system is however low. This is partially reflected by the poor understanding of the bioelectrochemical mechanisms behind the electron transfer from these microorganisms to the electrode surface. In this work, we propose a combination of electrochemical and fluorescence techniques, giving emphasis to the pulse amplitude modulation fluorescence. The combination of these two techniques allow us to obtain information that can assist in understanding the electrical response obtained from the generation of electricity through the intrinsic properties related to the photosynthetic efficiency that can be obtained from the fluorescence emitted. These were achieved quantitatively by means of observed changes in four photosynthetic parameters with the bioanode generating electricity. These are the maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), alpha (alpha), light saturation coefficient (Ek) and maximum rate of electron transfer (rETRm). The relationship between the increases in the current density collected by the bioanode to the decrease of the rETRm values in the photosynthetic pathway for the two microorganisms was also discussed.","[Ciniciato, Gustavo P.

Up-flow membrane-less single-chambered MFC (UFML MFC) was used to investigate the effect of surface morphology of carbon material as aqueous biocathode. Pt-loaded carbon paper, carbon felt, and carbon plate were examined and compared on the power output, surface morphology for biofilm formation, Coulombic efficiency (CE), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction. The COD reduction was up to 90% in UFML MFC with Pt-loaded carbon paper, carbon felt, and carbon plate as aqueous biocathodes. The results obtained showed that the performance in voltage output was not related to internal resistance but mainly due to the ability of cathode material in oxygen reduction process. The performance of voltage output with different materials as aqueous biocathode was mainly based on to the surface morphology as it was related to the ability of biofilm formation. Roughness of aqueous biocathode's surface morphology could prompt the biofilm growth, while biofilm overgrowth on aqueous biocathode could decrease voltage output. Therefore, smoother surface morphology of aqueous biocathode is more suitable for long-term operation.","[Thung, Wei-Eng; Ong, Soon-An; Wong, Yee-Shian; Ridwan, Fahmi; Oon, Yoong-Ling; Oon, Yoong-Sin; Lehl, Harvinder Kaur] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Environm Engn, Water Res Grp WAREG, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia; [Ho, Li-Ngee] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Mat Engn, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia","Ong, SA (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Environm Engn, Water Res Grp WAREG, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia.",ongsoonan@yahoo.com,"Lehl, Harvinder Kaur/AAK-6862-2020; Ho, Li Ngee/I-4614-2017; Oon, Yoong Sin/AAK-2103-2020; Oon, Yoong-Ling/AAK-2058-2020; Fahmi, Muhammad Ridwan/F-5541-2011; Thung, Wei-Eng/Z-5447-2019","Fahmi, Muhammad Ridwan/0000-0001-6331-3678; Thung, Wei-Eng/0000-0002-8701-4899; Lehl, Harvin/0000-0002-5322-4492; Oon, Yoong-Ling/0000-0001-6612-6739; YEE-SHIAN, WONG/0000-0002-6238-5247; Oon, Yoong-Sin/0000-0001-6581-8194","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI)Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia [02-01-15-SF0201]","This research was supported by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) ScienceFund (Grant No.02-01-15-SF0201).

In this study, a single-chambered photo catalytic fuel cell using ZnO/Zn as the photoanode and platinum loaded carbon as the cathode was constructed, and Reactive Green 19 was used as the organic pollutant. Operating parameters such as aeration, organic pollutant and photoanode were evaluated. Electricity generation and degradation efficiency were investigated in the presence of different supporting electrolytes such as sodium chloride, sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate. The results indicated that the addition of sodium sulfate as the supporting electrolyte afforded the highest short circuit current: 2.64 mA cm(-2) and a maximum power density of 1.2696 mW cm(-2). However, in terms of photocatalytic degradation, the presence of sodium chloride as the supporting electrolyte led to the highest dye degradation efficiency. In addition to electrolytes, the voltage output and degradation rate were significantly affected by different initial concentrations of dye. Ultraviolet Visible spectroscopy and chemical oxygen demand analysis determined that 100% decolorization and 92% mineralization of 10 mg L-1 of dye could be achieved after 8 h using sodium chloride as the supporting electrolyte in an aerated photocatalytic fuel cell.

The one-dimensional mass transport of chemical species is modelled using isothermal, single-phase and steady-state assumptions. The anode and cathode electrochemical reactions use the Tafel kinetics approach, with two limiting cases, for the reaction order. The model fully accounts for the mixed potential effects of ethanol oxidation at the cathode due to ethanol crossover via an alkaline anion-exchange membrane. In contrast to a polymer electrolyte membrane model, the current model considers the flux of ethanol at the membrane as the difference between diffusive and electroosmotic effects. The model is used to investigate the effects of the ethanol and alkali inlet feed concentrations at the anode. The model predicts that the cell performance is almost identical for different ethanol concentrations at a low current density. Moreover, the model results show that feeding the DEAFC with 5 M NaOH and 3 M ethanol at specific operating conditions yields a better performance at a higher current density. Furthermore, the model indicates that crossover effects on the DEAFC performance are significant. The cell performance decrease from its theoretical value when a parasitic current is enabled in the model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Abdullah, S.; Kamarudin, S. K.; Hasran, U.

The main advantage of the results obtained from this study is facilitating the use of carbon-free fuels instead of carbon-based ones and consequently reducing the energy consumption. Because such cells are nonlinear, multivariable systems that are difficult to model through traditional methods hence SVMs, which are powerful tools for predicting PEMFC performance, are used. Experimental data obtained from a 250 W PEMFC were used to predict parameters to describe the V-I, P-I, and efficiency -power curves, and then, the data was applied to predict overall PEMFC performance. To evaluate the functionality of suggested model, this method has been compared with multi layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network model. It has been demonstrated that, the error of SVM model is much smaller than MLP, and the proposed approach has better performance to predict the PEM fuel cell curve for the electrical bicycle. It was shown that the coefficient of determination in the SVM prediction model for power current curve is approximately 99%, which is 97% for MLP model that makes the proposed black box SVM PEMFC model suitable for monitoring and simulating fuel cell performance in the electrical bicycle that is beneficial for its variety of energy saving applications.

This technique is known as autocorrelation Levinson-Durbin recursion (ACLDR) model. To test the performance of this technique, the SEM image is corrupted with noise. The autocorrelation function of the original image and the noisy image are formed. The signal spectrum based on the autocorrelation function of image is formed. ACLDR is then used as an SNR estimator to quantify the signal spectrum of noisy image. The SNR values of the original image and the quantified image are calculated. The ACLDR is then compared with the three existing techniques, which are nearest neighbourhood, first-order linear interpolation and nearest neighbourhood combined with first-order linear interpolation. It is shown that ACLDR model is able to achieve higher accuracy in SNR estimation. Lay description High resolution microscopy images are commonly used for studying anode layers and other components used in fuel cells. The performance of fuel cell materials is largely governed by their transport properties. Fluid, ions and electronic conductivity in particular depend on the microstructure. Understanding and modeling their morphology at the microscopic scale is therefore critical to develop new devices with improved properties. In this study, several methods are employed to model these media, based on three types of anode layers of different origins and aspect. A general methodology is used to represent materials made of three different phases, based on two random 3D sets which are independently chosen. The independent models are computed according to statistical measurement carried out on the experimental images. The best model, which reproduces the correlation function of the experimental images and other statistical features, is shown to model accurately the three types of anode layers investigated. The correlation function of the anode layers is also modeled, which can serves as the basis for generic models of these materials.","[Sim, K. S.; Lim, M. S.; Yeap, Z.

The key existing challenges for fuel cell commercialization are performance, design and vehicle efficiency. Since the analytical model expressing fuel cells' characteristics is not accurate in comparison with the real system's performance a robust and dynamic model for fuel cells is of great importance. This study aims to introduce an optimized model for PEMFC using an electric bicycle that consists of a 250 W fuel cell, battery pack, DC/DC convertor, electric motor and electric control unit (ECU). In the first phase of this multi-fold study, the analytical model of PEMFC's efficiency has been compared with the experimental results obtained from the electric bicycle. The result of this phase showed an overall system efficiency of 35.4% and a maximum fuel cell efficiency of 63%. This confirms that fuel cell performance is least efficient when functioning under maximum output power conditions. In the second phase of this research, the collected data was used for developing linear and nonlinear regression models. The resulting model was compared with an artificial neural network used for the same purpose, and their prediction efficiencies compared. Results show that neural network modelling improves accuracy and provides promising performance for the electric bicycle system. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The scaffold was then metallized with silver using Tollens' reaction, followed by electrodeposition of nickel from a Watt's bath. The electrodes (Ni/Ag/GDC) were tested in both symmetrical and fuel cell configurations. The microstructures of the Ni/Ag/GDC anodes were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Nano-particles of Ni formed in the porous GDC scaffold provided triple phase boundaries (TPB). The electronic conductivity of the Ni/Ag/GDC (3.5/24.7/71.8 vol%) electrode was good even at relatively low Ni volume fractions. The electrochemical performance was examined in different concentrations of humidified hydrogen (3% H2O) and over a range of temperatures (600-750 degrees C).

In this paper, PVDF membrane was incorporated with gas selective SAPO-34 zeolite and blended with hydrolytically stable polybenzimidazole (PBI) to engineer a membrane contactor with additional functionality and stability. The effects of inorganic fillers and PBI on the membranes properties and the CO2 absorption performance were studied. In addition, the results were compared to PVDF membrane with PBI, modified and unmodified SAPO-34 zeolite. The hydrophilic SAPO-34 zeolite was modified into the hydrophobic SAPO-34 zeolite using fluorocarbon silane. The CO2 flux of PVDF membrane increased 60% when it was blended with 10 wt% of SAPO-34. The presence of SAPO-34 in PVDF membrane enriched membrane porosity and affinity towards CO2. The PVDF membrane with hydrophobic SAPO-34 exhibited a dense membrane structure, resulting in a great membrane resistance for CO2 transfer. Although PVDF membrane with both PBI and SAPO-34 (P-5S34-5PBI) showed lower CO2 flux than the PVDF membrane with SAPO-34 (P-10S34), the addition of 5 wt% of PBI provided better membrane stability in the corrosive solution.

The unique atom-thick 2D structure with sp(2) hybridization and large specific surface area, high thermal conductivity, superior electron mobility, and chemical stability have made GR and its derivatives extremely attractive components for composite materials for solar energy conversion, energy storage, environmental purification, and biosensor applications. This review gives a brief introduction of GR's unique structure, band structure engineering, physical and chemical properties, and recent energy-related progress of GR-based materials in the fields of energy conversion (e.g., photocatalysis, photoelectrochemical water splitting, CO2 reduction, dye-sensitized and organic solar cells, and photosensitizers in photovoltaic devices) and energy storage (batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors). The vast coverage of advancements in environmental applications of GR-based materials for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, gas sensing, and removal of heavy-metal ions is presented. Additionally, the use of graphene composites in the biosensing field is discussed. We conclude the review with remarks on the challenges, prospects, and further development of GR-based materials in the exciting fields of energy, environment, and bioscience.","[Tahir, Asif Ali; Ullah, Habib; Sundaram, Senthilarasu] Univ Exeter, ESI, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England; [Sudhagar, Pitchaimuthu] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Belfast BT9 5AG, Antrim, North Ireland; [Teridi, Mohd Asri Mat] Natl Univ Malaysia, Solar Energy Res Inst, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Devadoss, Anitha] Swansea Univ, Coll Engn, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales","Tahir, AA; Sundaram, S (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, ESI, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.; Teridi, MAM (corresponding author), Natl Univ Malaysia, Solar Energy Res Inst, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",a.tahir@exeter.ac.uk; hu203@exeter.ac.uk; S.Pitchaimuthu@qub.ac.uk; asri@ukm.edu.my; anitha.devadoss@swansea.ac.uk; s.sundaram@exeter.ac.uk,"Mat Teridi, Mohd Asri/B-1801-2016; Devadoss, Anitha/X-7366-2019; Devadoss, Anitha/F-5731-2012; TAHIR, ASIF/A-2515-2014; Ullah, Habib/S-9557-2019; Sundaram, Senthilarasu/AAN-1030-2020","Mat Teridi, Mohd Asri/0000-0003-2812-8447; Devadoss, Anitha/0000-0002-8052-1820; TAHIR, ASIF/0000-0003-1985-6127; Ullah, Habib/0000-0001-9290-0265; ",National University of Malaysia [ICONIC-2013-005]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/M006301/1] Funding Source: researchfish,The authors would like to thank the National University of Malaysia for providing financial assistance with grant number ICONIC-2013-005.,,487,37,37,1,184,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1527-8999,1528-0691,,CHEM REC,Chem.

The content of ZrO2 nanoclusters in the membrane matrix was varied from 0 to 10 wt%. The parameters of the acid doping reaction were optimized by the response surface method (RSM). The membrane properties were evaluated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), universal mechanical tester and DC impedance. The incorporation of 5 wt% ZrO2 nanoclusters increased the acid doping level and remarkably enhanced the proton conductivity of the membrane. A maximum proton conductivity of 60.0 mS/cm was recorded compared to 21.5 and 12.0 mS/cm for pristine and 10 wt% ZrO2 containing membranes at 150 degrees C and dry condition, respectively. The membrane with 5 wt% ZrO2 also showed the highest performance in a single cell at 120 degrees C under dry conditions. The results suggest that the composite membrane containing 5 wt% ZrO2 nanoclusters has a potential for application in high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell application.

Although it has been broadly employed with numerous successful applications, the Butler-Volmer equation needs to be solved numerically to find the activation overpotential, which results in the increase of the calculation difficulties. There are also some parameters in Butler-Volmer equation such as exchange current density and symmetry factor that are not always known parameters. In order to avoid the latest mentioned limitation and the numerical calculation which is time consuming and for simplification, there are some approximation equations such as Tafel, linear low polarization, and hyperbolic sine approximation. However, all these equations are only applicable in a specific range of current density or definite condition. The aim of this paper is to present a new form of Butler-Volmer equation using algebraic operation to calculate activation overpotential. The devised equation should be accurate, have a wide application range, able to remove any numerical calculation, and be useful to find exchange current density. In this research, a new form of Butler-Volmer equation and a new approximation equation (called K-J equation) have been successfully derived. The comparison result shows that the new derived form is exactly equal to the Butler-Volmer equation to calculate the activation overpotential, and it removed the necessity of numerical calculation to find the activation overpotential. In addition, the K-J approximation has a good agreement with Butler-Volmer equation over a wide range of current density and is applicable to predict the activation loss.","[Esfeh, H.

The results showed that the addition up to 1 wt% had negligible effect on the mechanical properties of the ceramic. The samples containing up to 1 wt% MnO2 attained above 97.5% relative density, Vickers hardness of 13-14 GPa and fracture toughness of about 3 MPam(1/2). In addition, it was revealed that the 0.5 wt% MnO2 addition was beneficial in suppressing the cubic zirconia grain growth i.e. the highest average grain size was measured at 4.9 mu m when sintered at 1550 degrees C as compared to 9.9 mu m measured for the undoped zirconia when sintered at the same temperature. On the other hand, the addition of 5 wt% MnO2 was found to be detrimental to the densification and properties of the zirconia, particularly when sintered at higher temperatures. This was attributed to the accelerated grain growth of the doped samples, i.e. the grain size increased by 2 fold, to 18.6 mu m when sintered at 1550 degrees C.","[Ng, C. K.; Ramesh, S.; Tan, C.

In this study, GO nanosheets from aqueous dispersion were pre-assembled on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode and then electrochemically reduced in 1 M KOH under various constant reduction potentials in the range of -0.6 V to -1.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy analyses revealed that the graphitic structure was substantially restored in the resulting electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO). The ERGO electrodes exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline medium compared with the initial GO electrode. Of the ERGO electrodes produced at various cathodic potentials, the ERGO-1.2 V electrode, which was produced at a reduction potential of -1.2 V, demonstrated the best catalytic activity toward the ORR in an alkaline medium. The ORR on GO and ERGO electrodes was shown to proceed via a two-electron mechanism at low overpotentials. The agreement between the spectroscopy results and electrochemical measurements provide strong evidence that the enhanced ORR catalytic activity is mainly attributed to the restoration of GO's graphitic structure. Furthermore, the ERGO-1.2 V electrode showed excellent tolerance to the methanol poisoning effect compared with a Pt/C catalyst electrode. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The optimum powder slurry was used to fabricate LSC/BCZY64/LSC half-cells using BaCe0.54Zr0.36Y0.1O2.95 (BCZY64) as the electrolyte material. The produced powder was characterized by thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the half-cell, by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. TGA results showed that the thermal decomposition temperature (T (td)) increased as the heating rate increased. The minimum and maximum T (td) was observed at 600 A degrees C (2 A degrees C min(-1)) and 750 A degrees C (15 A degrees C min(-1)), respectively. The XRD results confirmed that a single perovskite phase of LSC formed at heating/cooling rates of 2, 5 and 10 A degrees C min(-1) at calcination temperatures of 800, 900 and 1000 A degrees C, respectively. A single perovskite phase of LSC was not observed at a heating/cooling rate of 15 A degrees C min(-1). The smallest particle size (130-260 nm) was obtained at 800 A degrees C with a heating/cooling rate of 5 A degrees C min(-1), as shown in the SEM micrographs. The area specific resistance of the half-cell was 2.96, 0.97, 0.48 and 0.19 Omega cm(2) at 500, 600, 700 and 800 A degrees C, respectively. This result indicates that the prepared LSC cathode has the potential to be used with the BCZY64 electrolyte for an intermediate temperature proton-conducting SOFC.

The study focuses on 0.1 and 0.5% volume concentrations of Al2O3 dispersed in 60:40 and 50:50 of water (W)-ethylene glycol (EG) mixtures as coolant in a carbon graphite PEM fuel cell cooling plate. The study was conducted in a cooling plate with 22 parallel mini channels and large fluid distributors under constant heat load of 100 W. The effect of different flow rates to heat transfer enhancement and fluid flow in Reynolds number range of 20-120 was observed. Positive heat transfer enhancement was obtained where the heat transfer was improved up to 23% and 21% for 0.5% concentration Al2O3 nanofluid in 60:40 and 50:50 (W:EG) consecutively as compared to the base fluid. However, higher pressure drop was also experienced as much as 17% and 20% for 0.5% concentration Al2O3 in 60:40 and 50:50 (W:EG) consecutively as compared to the base fluid. Combination of both heat transfer enhancements and pressure drop demerits was then analyzed using advantage ratio. The results implied that 0.1% Al2O3 in 60:40 (W:EG) is the most advantageous nanofluid candidate followed by 0.1% Al2O3 in 50:50 (W:EG). Both nanofluids have advantage ratio values of greater than 1.

In this work, the feasibility of membrane gas absorption (MGA) in the separation of CO2 from hydrogen was investigated. The blending of amorphorus polybenzimidazole (PBI) and semicrystalline polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) resulted in a nearly superhydrophobic and microporous membrane, showing its great potential to be applied in membrane gas absorption (MGA) for CO2 capture from biohydrogen. The presence of hydrogen bonding in the polymer blend due to donor (-NH-) and proton acceptor (-N=) of PBI encouraged the formation of miscibility blend. The hydrophobicity of PVDF membrane was only slightly affected even the loading of PBI was increased to 20 wt%. The incorporation of PBI into PVDF membrane also enhanced the melting temperature (T-m) to increase from 166 degrees C to 171 degrees C. The membrane pore size was greatly improved after blending. In a MGA system with water absorbent, the PVDF/PBI membrane with 20 wt% of PBI showed the highest CO2 flux of 4.16 x 10(-4) mol/m(2)s. More importantly, 67 % of the CO2 in a gas mixture of H-2 and CO2 could be removed using diethanolamine only. Copyright (c) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Membranes play an important role in the power generation of microbial fuel cells. Nafion 117, the most common proton exchange membrane (PEM), is expensive and this is the main obstacle for commercialization of MFC. In this study, four kinds of sulphonated poly ether ether ketone (SPEEK) with different degrees of sulphonation (DS) referred to hereafter as SPEEK 1 (Ds = 20.8%), SPEEK 2 (Ds = 41%), SPEEK 3 (Ds = 63.6%), and SPEEK 4 (DS = 76%), were fabricated, characterized and applied in an MFC. The membranes were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and their morphologies were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The degree of sulphonation was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Then the membranes were applied to the MFC system. The results indicated that the power produced by MFG with SPEEK 3 (68.64 mW/m(2)) was higher than with the other SPEEK membranes while it was lower than with Nafion 117 (74.8 mW/m(2)). SPEEK3 also had the highest chemical oxygen demand removal (91%) and coulombic efficiency (26%) compared to other SPEEK membranes. The cost evaluation suggests that application of SPEEK 3 is more cost effective than applications of the other types of SPEEK and Nafion 117, due to its high power density generation per cost.

An LSCF-SDCC composite cathode was prepared at 50: 50 weights percentage ratios. The LSCF-SDCC film was fabricated through electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method. EPD was conducted on both sides of the SDCC substrate to produce a symmetrical cell. The symmetrical cell was subjected to different sintering temperatures (550 degrees C to 750 degrees C) before undergoing microstructure analysis and an electrochemical performance test. The effects of sintering temperature change on film surface porosity were first investigated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and ImageJ analysis. Then, the relation of polarisation resistance, Rp, with the sintering temperatures was established through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. LSCF-SDCC that was sintered at 600 degrees C exhibited the lowest Rp value of 0.68 Omega when operated at 650 degrees C. The results showed that sintering temperature in the range of 550 degrees C to 650 degrees C is the best sintering temperature to produce a high-performance LSCF-SDCC composite cathode.","[Baharuddin, Nurul Akidah; Muchtar, Andanastuti; Somalu, Mahendra Rao; Sulong, Abu Bakar; Abdullah, Huda] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Sel Fuel, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia","Muchtar, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Sel Fuel, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",muchtar@ukm.edu.my,"Baharuddin, Nurul Akidah/G-2729-2017; Muchtar, Andanastuti/E-3806-2017; Somalu, Mahendra/C-9792-2013; Abdullah, Huda/H-9717-2016","Baharuddin, Nurul Akidah/0000-0003-1604-8749; Muchtar, Andanastuti/0000-0002-1599-8964; Sulong, Abu Bakar/0000-0003-4637-1758; Somalu, Mahendra Rao/0000-0003-1667-693X",,,,13,3,3,2,7,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,SELANGOR,"FACULTY SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, BANGI, SELANGOR, 43600, MALAYSIA",0126-6039,,,SAINS MALAYS,Sains Malays.,MAR,2016,45,3,,,,,459,465,,,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,DM2XE,WOS:000376210600016,,,,,1/2/2021,

To appraise the performance, the system is analysed with two case studies considering three modes of operation. For the case-1, typical per day average electricity and hot water demand for a single family have been considered to be 10.3 kWh and 235 l, respectively. For the case 2, electricity and hot water demand are considered for the 100 family members. Energy cost, payback period, future economic feasibility and the environmental impact of the system are analysed for both cases using an analytical approach. The overall system along with individual component efficiency has been evaluated, and the maximum efficiency of the overall system is found to be 48.64 % at the fuel cell operation mode. In the present study, the proposed system shows 42.4 % cost effectiveness at higher load. Energy costs for case-1 and case-2 have been found to be approximately $0.158 and $0.091 kWh(-1), respectively, at present. Energy costs are expected to be $0.112 and $0.045 kWh(-1) for the case-1 and case-2, respectively, considering future (i.e. for the year 2020) component cost.","[Akikur, R. K.; Ullah, K. R.; Ping, H.

The average influent of COD, NO3 and NH4+ were 624 mg/L, 142 mg/L, 40 mg/L, respectively and their removal efficiencies (1 day HRT) were 99%, 46%, and 96%, respectively. NO3 removal was relatively higher in the closed circuit system due to lower dissolved oxygen in the system. Despite larger electrode spacing, the voltage outputs from Anode 2 (A2) (30 cm) and Anode 3 (A3) (45 cm) were higher than from Anode 1 (A1) (15 cm) as a result of insufficient fuel supply to A1.

POME can be treated in an efficient bioreactor under controlled conditions to produce high value biohydrogen mixture containing CO2. The H-2 existence in the valuable gas mixture (in a reasonable quantity) could be used as a clean energy source for renewable energy i.e., in hydrogen fuel cell. CO2 presence in fuel cell causes CO2 poisoning and affects its performance. Therefore, the purification of H-2 from CO2 produced from POME fermentation is desirable to ensure that an appropriate purity of H-2 is achieved. This work focused on the performance of gas membrane separation technology; by specifically using two different polymeric membranes, namely polysulfone (PSF) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Based on the results obtained, the selectivity for H-2/CO2 was achieved using PSF membranes; with the values obtained of 1.54-3.32 at a pressure of 1-8 bar. This result shows that PSF membranes have better performance for H-2 purification than PDMS membranes. This is supported by the analysis of the membranes after the test, which includes Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analyses. PSF membranes showed no changes on their FTIR spectra after permeation, while PDMS membranes, of 75 and 200 mu m thicknesses, recorded higher transmittance of their spectra after permeation. The flexibility of the PDMS membranes is evidence of more permeance of the hydrogen mixture that leads to less selectivity of H-2/CO2. Meanwhile, SEM and AFM analyses proved the morphology effects; which include changes of pore size distribution cross-section, membrane thickness and surface roughness, after permeation of the applied pressure from 1 to 8 bar, which was possibly due to the compaction effect.

Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) was used to form a SiO2 coating on Fe2O3 nanoparticle surface (Fe2O3@SiO2). The presence of SiO2 layer would facilitate the formation of Fe2O3 on the TiO2 surface by an electrostatic attraction that led to the formation of TiO2Fe2O3@SiO2. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results revealed the successful attachment of Fe2O3@SiO2 particles to the TiO2 surface and a uniform distribution of TiO2-Fe2O3@SiO2 composites on the rGO sheet. Furthermore, the rGO/TiO2-Fe2O3@SiO2 nanohybrid modified platinum (Pt) electrode was used for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol in alkaline medium. The rGO/TiO2-Fe2O3@SiO2 nanohybrid with weight ratio of 1:3:1 (rGO:TiO2:Fe2O3) showed a higher electrocatalytic activity toward methanol oxidation with an anodic peak current density of 2.45 mA/cm(2). Moreover, the nanohybrid displayed a higher stability with 91.58% retention of the initial current density after 5000 s in long term current-time curve. This newly prepared rGO/TiO2-Fe2O3@SiO2 nanohybrid could be a promising anodic catalyst for the direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) application. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Whilst a significant amount of work has been reported on large-scale cultivation of microalgae using photo-bioreactors and pond systems, research focus on establishing high performance downstream dewatering operations for large-scale processing under optimal economy is limited. The enormous amount of energy and associated cost required for dewatering large-volume microalgal cultures has been the primary hindrance to the development of the needed biomass quantity for industrial-scale microalgal biofuels production. The extremely dilute nature of large-volume microalgal suspension and the small size of microalgae cells in suspension create a significant processing cost during dewatering and this has raised major concerns towards the economic success of commercial-scale microalgal biofuel production as an alternative to conventional petroleum fuels. This article reports an effective framework to assess the performance of different dewatering technologies as the basis to establish an effective two-stage dewatering system. Bioflocculation coupled with tangential flow filtration (TFF) emerged a promising technique with total energy input of 0.041 kWh, 0.05 kg CO2 emissions and a cost of 0.0043 for producing 1 kg of microalgae biomass. A streamlined process for operational analysis of two-stage microalgae dewatering technique, encompassing energy input, carbon dioxide emission, and process cost, is presented.","[Soomro, Rizwan R.; Danquah, Michael K.] Curtin Univ Technol, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Ndikubwimana, Theoneste; Lu, Yinghua] Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Xianhai; Lin, Lu] Xiamen Univ, Coll Energy, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Xianhai; Lu, Yinghua] Xiamen Univ, Key Lab Synthet Biotechnol Xiamen City, Xiamen, Peoples R China","Danquah, MK (corresponding author), Curtin Univ Technol, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Sarawak, Malaysia.; Zeng, XH (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Energy, Xiamen, Peoples R China.; Zeng, XH (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Key Lab Synthet Biotechnol Xiamen City, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",xianhai.zeng@xmu.edu.cn; mkdanquah@curtin.edu.my,"Zeng, Xianhai/H-1317-2018","Zeng, Xianhai/0000-0002-5441-3164; Danquah, Michael/0000-0002-4232-7138","Special Fund for Fujian Ocean High-Techindustry Development, China [2013015]; Research Program from Science and Technology Bureau of Xiamen City in China [3502Z20151254]; Xiamen UniversityXiamen University; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council; Government of Rwanda through Rwanda Education Board (REB)","This research project was financially supported by the Special Fund for Fujian Ocean High-Techindustry Development (No. 2013015), China, and the Research Program from Science and Technology Bureau of Xiamen City in China (3502Z20151254).

The results illustrated that SPEEK has changed the morphology of membranes and increase their hydrophilicity. PS/SPEEK with lower DS (29%) had the rejection percentage of 62% for NaCl and 68% for MgSO4; while it was 67% and 81% for PS/SPEEK (76%) at 4 bars. Furthermore, the water flux for PS at 10 bar was 12.41 L m(-2) h(-1). It was four times higher for PS/SPEEK (29%) which means 49.5 L m(-2) h(-1) and 13 times higher for PS/SPEEK (76%) with means 157.76 L m(-2) h(-1). However, in MFC (microbial fuel cell), the highest power production was 97.47 mW/m(2) by PS/SPEEK (29%) followed by 41.42 mW/m(2) for PS/SPEEK (76%), and 9.4 mW/m(2) for PS. This revealed that the sulfonation of PEEK (poly ether ether ketone) made it a better additive for PS for desalination, because it created a membrane with higher hydrophilicity, better pore size and better for salt rejection. Although for the separator, the degree of sulfonation was limited; otherwise it made a membrane to transfer some of the unwanted ions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A dip -coating technique was used to coat SiC, Ni, and Cr powders on a pre-sintered porous Al2O3 substrate. The morphological properties of the sintered Al2O3 plain substrates and coating layer were observed using a light microscope and scanning electron microscopy. The combustion analyzer has been calibrated and used to measure the emissions during the experiment. Thermoelectric cells were used in the cogeneration system to generate electricity from the porous medium burner. The results show a significant improvement in the maximum surface flame temperature and combustion emissions over the plain substrate. The highest recorded surface flame temperature at flow rate of 0.25 L/min was 750 degrees C for SiC-coated, 741 degrees C for Cr-coated, 739 degrees C for Ni-coated and plain substrate registered a temperature of only 634 degrees C. An 18% increase in flame temperature was recorded for SiC-coated substrate when compared to the plain substrate. Moreover, the coated substrate reduced the emissions CO, COu and NOx. It was also found that; SiC-coated substrate reported the best overall power output when compared to the plain substrate. (C) 2015 Energy Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Biofouling is one of the major obstacles to the efficiency and economic operation of MFCs. The present study investigated and characterized the formation of biofouling on membranes at three different time frames within six months of MFC operations and the effect of biofouling on the performance of MFCs. The membranes were characterized by analyzing changes in the surface morphology, membrane structure, proton conductivity and resistance. The biofouling layer on the membrane increased over time during the MFCs' operation from 14.7 +/- 0.4 mu m. (at two months), 165.1 +/- 22.4 mu m (at four months) to 250.1 +/- 10.7 mu m (at six months). The morphology observed using scanning electron microscopy showed the enhancement of the growth and compactness of the bacteria formed on the membranes' surfaces. Organic and inorganic elements were identified as binding factors that could strengthen the biofouling layer. The increase in the thickness of the biofouling layer resulted in the reduction of the proton conductivity of the Nafion 117 membrane, which led to an increment in membrane resistance due to restrictions in proton transfer through the biofouling membrane. Based on the performance results, the power density of the MFC showed a 55% reduction from 1 W/m(2) at two months of operation to 0.45 W/m(2) at six months of operation. Therefore, the cumulative effect of biofouling on the membranes' surfaces during long-term operation obstructed the mobility of protons across the membrane, causing MFC performance to deteriorate.

SPS was synthesized using acetyl sulfate as a sulfonating agent in a reflux condenser under nitrogen atmosphere. The membrane casting was done without isolating the SPS. The SPS-Z membrane was fabricated by adding the zeolite to the SPS solution by the same technique. The synthesized SPS and SPS-Z membranes were characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy to identify the -SO3H functional group attached onto the polymer membrane, thermal stability, and surface morphology. The membranes were further examined for their water uptake capacity, swelling behavior, and degree of sulfonation. In addition, the performance of the fabricated membranes was examined based on their ion exchange capacity (IEC) and proton conductivity. The results revealed that both the membranes have good thermal and surface properties. The SPS-Z membrane has less swelling tendency than the SPS membrane due to lower water uptake capacity of SPS-Z membrane (2.5%) than the SPS membrane (3.5%). The proton conductivity of the SPS-Z membrane (1.11x10(-5)S/cm) is higher than the SPS membrane (1.68x10(-6)S/cm). The IEC capacity of SPS and SPS-Z membranes is found to be 0.03 and 0.17meq/g, respectively. The proton conductivity of SPS and SPS-Z membranes is comparable with the Nafion 117((R)) membrane (5.32x10(-6)S/cm) under the same experimental conditions indicates that the fabricated membranes have the good potential for membrane applications, especially for fuel cell applications.","[Rosdi, Anis Nurdhiani; Kang, Yee Li; Ibrahim, Shaliza; Pichiah, Saravanan] Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Environm Engn Lab, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Purushothaman, Monash] Univ Malaya, Dept Chem Engn, Ctr Separat Sci & Technol, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Pichiah, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Environm Engn Lab, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",saravananpichiah@um.edu.my,"Ibrahim, Shaliza/A-5854-2010; P, SARAVANAN/B-7471-2008","Ibrahim, Shaliza/0000-0001-9413-957X; /0000-0001-8302-9586","University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [UM.C/625/1/HIR/053/2, PG022-2013A]","This work was supported by High Impact Research Grant (UM.C/625/1/HIR/053/2) and Postgraduate Research Grant (PG022-2013A), University of Malaya.",,20,2,2,0,37,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1944-3994,1944-3986,,DESALIN WATER TREAT,Desalin.

They generally exhibit high ionic conductivity, good mechanical properties, excellent thermal and chemical stabilities. The six-membered ring, naphthalenic anhydride-based SPIs, not only exhibit superior chemical and thermo-oxidative stabilities but are also more resistant to hydrolysis than their five-membered phthalic anhydride-based SPIs. The composites based on napthalenic polyimides are also significantly stable in high temperature environment and show better stability to hydrolysis. Incorporation of inorganic fillers into organic polymers has gained tremendous attention and these new materials are called organic-inorganic hybrids. Few patents related to the synthesis and performance PEM materials have been reviewed and cited. Keeping in view the importance of sulfonated polyimide based nanocomposites as potential membrane materials for PEM in fuel cell, we have synthesized SPIs clay based nanocomposite as potential membrane material. The objective of this work was to synthesize clay based SPIs thin films which could be used as membrane materials in PEM fuel cell for energy applications. Methods/Experimental: At the first step the nanometric sheets of vermiculite clay prepared via sonication was surface modified by grafting 3-APTES. Then the SPI was synthesized via one-step high temperature direct imidization method, which serve as a matrix material. The organo modified VMT was dispersed via sonication in the SPI matrix. Four different sets of organic-inorganic nanocomposite membranes thin films, having VMT contents in the range of 1 to 7 wt.% were prepared by casting, curing and acidification route. Results: The synthesis of SPIs clay based thin films were carried out at three different steps and fully characterized. The synthesis of SPIs and SPIs clay based thin films were analyzed via different analytical techniques. The XRD analysis tells the successful dispersion of clay in SPI matrix. Different physiochemical tests were conducted for the analysis of these membranes such as water uptake, hydrolytic stability, ion exchange capacity (IEC), dimensional changes and oxidative stability, to check their suitability as membrane materials for PEM. The proton conductivity of these membranes were measured via impedance spectroscopy which discloses three different active regions responsible for proton conduction. The activation energies of the membranes were higher at lower temperature and reaches to 8.2 kJ/mol at higher temperature (90 degrees C). Conclusion: The synthesis of sulfonated polyimide/clay (SPI/clay) based organic-inorganic nanocomposite membranes were achieved successfully. The membrane display good hydrolytic, thermal and oxidative stability at elevated temperature. The proton conductivity of the membrane display an increase together with the frequency but decreases with temperature. Therefore some more efforts are required to achieve high degree of functionalization of both organic and inorganic components, for the future PEMs to avoid deterioration and to get improved performance.","[Ali, Farman; Shah, Syed Sakhawat; Rahim, Fazal] Hazara Univ, Dept Chem, Mansehra 21300, Pakistan; [Saeed, Shaukat] PIEAS, DMME, PO Nilore, Islamabad 45650, Pakistan; [Duclaux, Laurent; Leveque, Jean-Marc; Reinert, Laurence] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, LCME, F-73000 Chambery, France; [Leveque, Jean-Marc] Univ Teknol Petronas, Dept Fundamental & Appl Sci, Tronoh 31750, Perak, Malaysia","Ali, F (corresponding author), Hazara Univ, Dept Chem, Mansehra 21300, Pakistan.",farmanqau@gmail.com,"Saeed, Shaukat/G-9371-2012; RAHIM, FAZAL/AAC-9002-2021","Saeed, Shaukat/0000-0002-8061-1500; ",Higher Education Commission (HEC)Higher Education Commission of Pakistan,This work was supported by the Higher Education Commission (HEC) under 5000 Indigenous Ph.D. Fellowship program.,,44,3,4,0,30,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",1872-2105,2212-4020,,RECENT PAT NANOTECH,Recent Pat.

The use of ZnR-G in a PTB7:PC71BM-based inverted OPV device leads to substantial enhancement in device performance in contrast to the reference devices. The improved performance is attributed to the improved charge carrier separation and prolonged lifetime of the generated electron-hole pairs. In addition, we also found that extra pathways for the disappearance of the charge carriers exist due to the interactions between the excited ZnR and G, which shows that the ZnR-G have a lower recombination rate of electrons and holes under UV light illumination.","[Kim, Jeongmo; Yusoff, Abd.

An EPD suspension which is based on an organic aqueous solution was used, and a mixture of ethanol and deionized water was used as medium with poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (PDADMAC) as a dispersing agent. SDCC substrate was used, and EPD was performed on both sides. A symmetrical cell with cathode composite LSCF-SDCC films on both sides of the substrate was subjected to sintering at five different temperatures (from 550 degrees C to 750 degrees C). A symmetrical cell was painted using silver paste before undergoing electrochemical performance test (air condition), in which the impedance, Z data, was measured. The effects ofsintering temperature change on element content and film porosity were first investigated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and J-image analysis. Ceramic-based cathode LSCF-SDCC that was sintered at 600 degrees C exhibited the lowest Rp at a value of 0.68 Omega when operated at 650 degrees C.

Three cells were created using Andean soil, each one for monitoring a BOD concentration of synthetic washed rice wastewater (SRWW) of 10, 100, and 200 mg/L for SMFC1, SMFC2 and SMFC3, respectively. The results showed transient, exponential, and steady stages in the SMFCs. The maximum open circuit voltage (OCV) peaks were reached during the elapsed time of the transient stages, according to the tested BOD concentrations. A good linearity between OCV and time was observed in the increasing stage. The average OCV in this stage increased independently of the tested concentrations. SMFC1 required less time than SMFC2 to reach the steady stage, suggesting the BOD concentration is an influencing factor in SMFCs, and SMFC3 did not reach it. The OCV ratios were between 40.6-58.8 mV and 18.2-32.9 mV for SMFC1 and SMFC2. The reproducibility of the SMFCs was observed in four and three cycles for SMFC1 and SMFC2, respectively.

This paper presents the use of a H-type MFC involving a novel NAR-2 bacterial consortium consisting of Citrobacter sp. A1, Enterobacter sp. L17 and Enterococcus sp. C1 to produce electricity whilst simultaneously decolourising acid red 27 (AR27) as a model dye, which is also known as amaranth. In this setup, the dye AR27 is mixed with modified P5 medium (2.5 g/L glucose and 5.0 g/L nutrient broth) in the anode compartment, whilst phosphate buffer solution (PBS) pH 7 serves as a catholyte in the cathode compartment. After several electrochemical analyses, the open circuit voltage (OCV) for 0.3 g/L AR27 with 24-h retention time at 30 A degrees C was recorded as 0.950 V, whereas (93 %) decolourisation was achieved in 220-min operation. The maximum power density was reached after 48 h of operation with an external load of 300 Omega. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed the surface morphology of the anode and the bacterial adhesion onto the electrode surface. The results of this study indicate that the decolourisation of AR27 dye and electrical power generation was successfully achieved in a MFC operated by a bacterial consortium. The consortium of bacteria was able to utilise AR27 in a short retention time as an electron acceptor and to shuttle the electrons to the anode surface for bioelectricity generation.","[Kardi, Seyedeh Nazanin; Ibrahim, Norahim; Rashid, Noor Aini Abdul] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Biosci & Hlth Sci, Utm Johor Bahru 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Darzi, Ghasem Najafpour] Babol Noshirvani Univ Technol, Biotechnol Res Lab, Fac Chem Engn, Babol Sar 4714871167, Iran","Kardi, SN (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Biosci & Hlth Sci, Utm Johor Bahru 81310, Johor, Malaysia.; Darzi, GN (corresponding author), Babol Noshirvani Univ Technol, Biotechnol Res Lab, Fac Chem Engn, Babol Sar 4714871167, Iran.",nazanin_kardi@yahoo.com; norahim@utm.my; nooraini_nar@utm.my; najafpour@nit.ac.ir,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [07H73]","The author wishes to acknowledge the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, for providing the Research University Grant (RUG), Vote No. 07H73, to carry out the present research and to UTM for providing the laboratory facilities.",,24,6,6,0,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

The GPTMS modified MMT was mixed with chitosan in acetic acid solution and cast into membranes. SEM images and FTIR analysis showed that the O-MMT was successfully incorporated into the chitosan polymer matrix. Water and methanol uptake of the Ch/O-MMT composite membranes decreased with increasing O-MMT loadings, but the ion exchange capacity (IEC) value increased.

Numerical simulation technology, with its significant lessening of time needed and saving experimental costs required was used in this study. Results show that a better power performance was found at a condition of 0.125 G and Reynolds number Re = 41.3 regardless of flow channel in MFCs. In addition, the bio-mixer channel of the flow channels in MFCs will have a better performance than the other two channels because of its lower pressure drop and higher power generation.

The minimum operation cost of this integrated energy system is achieved by proper scheduling of different energy resources, found by applying a new powerful optimization algorithm, the Hyper-Spherical Search (HSS) algorithm, to the system's scheduling problem. This is the first time that HSS is used to face the energy resource dispatch problem. The HSS has been only tested in mathematical problems in the previous study. The optimization procedure generates an efficient look-up table in which the powers generated by different energy resources are determined for all time intervals. The effect of different electricity tariffs for purchasing electricity from the main grid on the operation costs of the system is investigated. Moreover, a battery is properly dispatched in the energy system to decrease the operation costs. A real load demand is used in the simulation. The results of HSS are compared with the harmony search algorithm and the colonial competitive algorithm to show the power and effectiveness of HSS to find the optimal dispatch strategy of energy resources for the first time. This is the first time that HSS is compared with CCA. The results of this paper are expected to contribute to home energy systems and real projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The study aims to provide generic information on the effects of membrane preparation on the morphology and mechanical properties of YSZ hollow fibre membranes. In this work, ceramic suspensions were prepared by mixing YSZ particles, dispersant, polymer binder and organic solvent using a planetary ball milling machine. This process was followed by extrusion into a coagulation bath via an air gap, drying and sintering process at temperatures ranging from 1250 degrees C to 1400 degrees C. The results show that by varying the YSZ loading and YSZ/PESf ratio, different morphologies of ceramic hollow fiber membranes can be obtained due to variations in the viscosities of ceramic suspensions. Similarly, air-gap length between the spinneret and coagulant surface was found to affect the growth of the finger-like structures and sponge-like regions. Varying these parameters also gave significant effects on the mechanical strength of the ceramic membrane due to the change in membrane thickness and compactness. The sintering process had insignificant effects on the membrane morphology but the process can be used to enhance the mechanical strength of ceramic hollow fiber membranes. The optimum temperature of the sintering process was identified. It was found that increasing the sintering temperature further caused a reduction in the mechanical strength due to crack formation in the ceramic hollow fiber membrane. The preliminary performance tests showed that the ceramic hollow fiber membrane sintered at 1300 degrees C has a pure water flux of 118.4 L/m(2) h. It also has a high PEG rejection with molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of 60 kDa. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

The performance of UFML MFC was evaluated in terms of voltage output, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and color removal efficiency by varying the concentration of AO7 in synthetic wastewater. The results shown the voltage generation and COD removal efficiency decreased as the initial AO7 concentration increased; this indicates there is electron competition between anode and azo dye. Furthermore, there was a phenomenon of further decolorization at cathode region which indicates the oxygen and azo dye are both compete as electron acceptor. Based on the UV-visible spectra analysis, the breakdown of the azo bond and naphthalene compound in AO7 were confirmed. These findings show the capability of integrated UFML MFC in azo dye wastewater treatment and simultaneous electricity generation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds (e.g., imidazole derivatives) are well known for their potential to assist proton hopping through hydrogen bond networks at high temperatures. Among the many imidazole derivatives reported thus far, 1,3,5-tri(2-benzimidazolyl)benzene (TBIB) is assumed to be one of the most promising imidazole derivatives because of its triple-stranded three-dimensional hydrogen bond network In fact, TBIB immersed into a polyphosphoric add matrix was reported to enhance the proton conductivity to 10(-2)-10(-1) S/cm in the high-temperature range up to 170 degrees C In the present work, the proton transfer mechanism has been investigated using density functional theory (DFT) with a DNP basis set and the GGA exchange-correlation functional BLYP and molecular dynamics simulations (MD) to provide insight into the cause of the remarkable proton conductivity of TBIB. Transition states in the proton hopping process were obtained using two types of models constructed from the X-ray crystal structure: an isolated two-molecule system (type I) and a periodic three-molecule system (type II). Alterations of charge distribution, molecular conformation and molecular orientation were investigated from these models. Further, the diffusion coefficient of proton transfer has been estimated and the mechanisms along three specific channels that favor efficient proton transfer between the layers have been examined in detail. Additionally, the effect of an electric field perturbation was investigated for these two models. The application of an external electric field was found to affect the proton hopping process remarkably, as evidenced by large changes in the activation energies and proton hopping times. In conclusion, the highly organized hydrogen-bonding network observed for TBIB was found to be a key factor in enhancing the efficiency of proton transfer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the development of inexpensive and high-efficient cathode catalyst is the most critical challenge for MECs to become a commercialized H-2 production technology. In this study, a non-noble metal electroformed Ni mesh cathode alternatives to typical cathode material (Pt/CC) was intensively examined in a single-chamber membrane-free MEC. To the best of our knowledge, the use of electroformed Ni mesh as the MEC cathode catalyst has not been reported so far. The MEC was operated in fed-batch mode and the performance of the Ni mesh cathode was compared with that of Pt/CC cathode in terms of columbic efficiencies (75 +/- 4% vs. 72.7 +/- 1%), overall hydrogen recovery (89.3 +/- 4% vs. 90.9 +/- 3%), overall energy efficiency (62.9 +/- 5% vs. 69.1 +/- 2%), the maximum volumetric hydrogen production rate (4.18 +/- 1 m(3) H-2/m(3) d vs. 4.25 +/- 1 m(3) H-2/m(3) d), volumetric current density (312 +/- 9 A/m(3) vs. 314 +/- 5 A/m(3)).

Compared to biofuels supplied by oil palm, rapeseed, soybean and sugar cane, microalgae alone can be manipulated to generate larger amounts of biodiesel, bioethanol, biohydrogen and biomass in a shorter time. Apart from higher productivity, microalgae can also grow using brackish water on non-arable land, greatly reducing the competition with food and cash crops. Hence, numerous efforts have been put into the commercialisation of microalgae-derived biofuel by both the government and private bodies.

The production of RGO nanosheet is one of the important topics in nanotechnology disciplines due to its contribution in various applications, such as the platinum catalyst support in direct methanol fuel cell. Therefore, in this paper, the RGO nanosheets were prepared via highly efficient chemical reduction reaction of exfoliated GO nanosheets using sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4) as the reducing agent. Extensive characterizations have been conducted in terms of structural, thermal stability and electrical conductivity properties by means of high-resolution transmission microscopy, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, C-13 NMR and four-point probe conductivity measurement. The results indicate that most of oxygen-containing functional groups from GO nanosheets have been removed and the RGO-3 possess greater thermal stability compared to GO nanosheets. The prepared RGO-3 shows the highest electrical conductivity at room temperature which is similar to 2.0 x 10(3) S cm(-1). Based on these analyses, the plausible mechanism of reduction of GO to RGO by sodium oxalate is well proposed.","[Hanifah, Mohamad Fahrul Radzi; Jaafar, Juhana; Ismail, A. F.; Othman, M. H.

The model is divided into six subsystems. It can simulate performance based on mass/momentum transfer, diffusion through porous media, electrochemical reactions, polarization losses and heat generation inside the subsystems. The significance of this investigation involves the conversion of a macro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell into six connected micro-reactors in series. The model can successfully predict the dependence of current density on cell potential (observed experimentally). Thermal energy generation by means of fuel reactions as well as voltage irreversibility losses are simulated to account for efficiency losses using the experimental data. Increases in the efficiencies of electrical and thermal power generation by 50.11% and 47.54% are observed when the operating temperature rises from 923 to 1023 K. In addition, the effect of flow pressures and flow rates on solid oxide fuel cell performance is simulated and validated with the experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) made by doping nitrogen as an n-type dopant in carbon nanotubes, have been shown to possess catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Functionally modified NCNT can become a cheaper alternative electrochemical catalyst that is as good as the noble metals such as Pt. Since the efficiency of the fuel cell is dependent on cell temperatures, this study looks at the effects of the temperatures towards ORR over the temperature range of 298-343 K in 0.5 M H2SO4 on the metal-free NCNT using a thin-film rotating-ring disk electrode (RRDE). The NCNT catalysts were synthesized via chemical vapour deposition with ethylenediamine and iron phthalocyanine and post-treatment process was carried out prior to the analysis. The results showed that the optimum ORR activity in NCNT was achieved at 50 degrees C, beyond which, the ORR activity decreased. In order to increase ORR activity beyond this temperature, the NCNT should be modified by compositing it with other metal or non-metal to improve its activity at higher temperature.

The MnO2/f-CNT was characterised by the field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Raman spectra has proved there is more carbon defect on the surface of CNT after functionalization. XRD pattern showed amorphous MnO2 crystal existed in MnO2/f-CNT catalyst. This study further employed cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques to investigate catalytic activity. Lastly, microbial fuel cell test showed that MnO2/f-CNT displayed higher power density (520 mW m(-2)) compared to CNT (275 mW m(-2)) and f-CNT (440 mW m(-2)). Moreover, the coulombic efficiency (28.65%) and COD removal value (86.6%) of MFC with MnO2/f-CNT catalyst was higher amongst the three catalysts tested.

This study uses 24 full-factorial designs, a factorial arrangement with four factors at two-levels and one center point. The following factors are considered in this study: the inlet diameter of the inlet flow, the direction of the flow, the fuel cell orientation and the height of the second storage vessel. The inlet diameters of the inlet flow under consideration are 1.5, 2.38 and 4 mm. The directions of the flow are bottom and top. The orientation is selected between vertical and horizontal. The height of the second storage tank varies from 50 mm to 70 mm, in 10 mm intervals. The results show that the direction of the flow has the most significant effect on the greatest methanol flux, and the next most significant factor is the orientation, while the inlet diameter of the inflow and the height of the second storage vessel play only minor roles. However, the interaction between the inlet diameter of the inflow and the height of second storage tank shows a significant effect that must be considered.

One promising system is the Direct Ethanol Fuel Cell (DEFC) stacks, which are modular and simple to construct and have certain attributes, such as being a compact and lightweight cell, that make it favorable for portable applications. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges for DEFC commercialization, such as water transport management, EtOH crossover and the sluggish Ethanol Oxidation Reaction (EOR) kinetics on the anode. The phenomena involved with DEFCs are complicated and include transport processes, thermochemical reactions and fluid mechanics that are hard to quantify experimentally. On the other hand, mathematical modeling is a powerful and economical tool that enables us to better understand the physical phenomena that occur during operation. In this study, a conceptual design was developed to obtain a power performance curve. The voltage and current characteristics with the proposed MEA geometry will be used as starting point for more detailed modeling and simulation studies that aim to provide a basic understanding of the internal process of the DEFC.

The properties of GO-SPEEK, Nafion (R) 117 and SPEEK are then compared to ascertain their selectivity to proton transport compared to both water and oxygen. GO-SPEEK was found to have the highest selectivity with a water uptake of 85.4%, proton conductivity of 1.48 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) and oxygen diffusion coefficient of 1.154 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1). During tests in Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs), the MFC system with Nafion (R) 117 membrane produces the highest maximum power density (1013 mW m(-2)) followed by the MFCs with GO-SPEEK (902 mW m(-2)) and SPEEK (812 mW m(-2)) membranes. On the other hand, the MFC with GO-SPEEK membrane produces the highest coulombic efficiency (16.88%). The high efficiency and comparable maximum power density which is produced by the MFC with GO-SPEEK membrane, shows that GO-SPEEK membrane is a promising alternative membrane to replace the expensive Nafione 117 as a separator in the MFG.

Amongst the various thermochemical technologies for converting algal biomass to biofuels, Subcritical Water Extraction (SWE) demonstrates significant capacity for generating liquid transportation fuels from algae with minimal environmental impacts. The SWE process expends pressurized water to produce biocrude or bio-oil as well as aqueous, solid, or gaseous by-products. However, the existence of high levels of heteroatoms in biocrude hinders its application in internal combustion engines, and this has triggered studies into parametric characterization of biocrude production from algal biomass.

In this paper, the performance degradation of MEA in a single cell PEMFC was examined at 80 degrees C and a backpressure of 10 psi after 100 h of operational time using open circuit voltage (OCV) conditions. A control experiment was conducted by testing the MEA at ambient temperature without backpressure. Both electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and an OCV analysis showed that both the conductivity and the performance of the cell operating at 80 degrees C were less than the control values after 100 h of operation. In contrast, an application of 10 psi of backpressure improved the cell conductivity and can maintain OCV in compare with ambient and 80 degrees C conditions. Characterizations of the pre- and post-operation of the MEA (cathode, anode and membrane) by scanning electron microscope-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that the MEA performance degradation at 80 degrees C after 100 h resulted mainly from carbon corrosion combined with Pt agglomeration and dissolution, producing a PtS compound with reduced activity at both the cathode and the anode and also drying and cracking of the membrane.

Evaluating the thermal behavior of the designs based on stack temperature profiles alone would lead to inaccuracy as the initial temperatures and the stack thermal powers are different. Thus, the thermal behavior of the cooling modes was qualitatively analyzed via heat transfer analyses. An experimental approach is reported here using three stacks with varied cooling channel geometry and aspect ratio. Two stacks were designed on parallel multi channel (20 and 40 channels) straight flow configuration. The third stack applied the concept of non-linear laminar flow trajectory for the cooling channels. The 3-cell stacks were constructed with an active area of 240 cm(2). The cooling mode applied a cooling fan coupling of positive and negative pressure flows. Air flows were between Reynolds number of 200 and 400 while the humidity varied at 50% and 90%. The analytical methodology converted the first-order temperature profiles into second-order heat transfer profiles. The steady-state parameters studied were temperature uniformity, cooling response, average cooling rate, cooling effectiveness, cooling flux, the heat transfer coefficient and the mean local temperature difference. The width of analysis has successfully identified the dynamic capabilities of the individual cooling plate designs for further practical considerations.

The use of nano-materials to improve the performance of fuel cells has attracted the interest of researchers. The incorporation of nano-materials into these carbon-based electrodes is able to improve the performance of the electrodes. The aim of this study is to determine and optimize the parameter effecting the preparation of a nano-structured anode for high power density DMFCs. The two parameters investigated in this study were the Nafion content and the carbon loading. Both the traditional one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) and the response surface methodology (RSM) optimization techniques were used to determine the optimum parameters. The results from the OFAT study indicated that the possible optimum levels for the Nafion content and carbon nanofiber (CNF) loading range from 2.7 to 3.5 mg cm(-2) and 2.5 to 3.5 mg cm(-2), respectively. A quadratic model was developed based on the RSM results, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the model provides a good fit to the experimental data. This result indicated that the developed model successfully predicted the response with good accuracy. The maximum power density (response) was predicted-and experimentally validated using the optimum composition of a 3.04 mg cm(-2) Nafion content and 2.91 mg cm(-2) carbon loading. The model validation revealed that the experimental value obtained under the optimum conditions (21.90 mW cm(-2)) was in good agreement with the values predicted by the model (22.64 mW cm(-2)).

However, economically feasible and sustainable energy production from microalgae requires optimization of cultivation conditions for both biomass yield and lipid production of microalgae. Biomass yield and lipid production in microalgae are a contradictory problem because required conditions for both targets are different. Simultaneously, the mass cultivation of microalgae for biofuel production also depends extremely on the performance of the microalgae strains used. In this study a green unicellular microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana (DS6) isolated from the holding tanks of farm wastewater treatment plant using multi-step screening and acclimation procedures was found high-lipid producing facultative heterotrophic microalgae strain capable of growing on dairy farm effluent (DFE) for biodiesel feedstock and wastewater treatment.

The membrane was made using the method of coating, wherein the liquid polymer, Nafion and PTFE material were alternately injected into the surface of the ceramic tube. This step was performed in order to form the membrane layers. Two layers of PTFE were used to sandwich the Nafion layer, providing the Nafion with stability up to 300 degrees C. In contrast to the palladium membranes which have to be carried out at a high temperature, the resulted membrane can be operated at a low temperature (below 100 degrees C) and is still stable in temperature up to 300 degrees C. Moreover, the PTFE-Nafion membrane can also be employed in a membrane reactor to produCe hydrogen. The highest hydrogen permeation flux obtained from this membrane was 13.6 cm3 cm(-2) s(-1) at permselectivity of 3.2. Result showed that the hydrogen separation factor increased align with temperature rising. On the other hand, the hydrogen separation decreased in line with increasing value of pressure difference between permeate and retentate. This hydrogen separation phenomena revealed that the gas permeation in the membrane was dominated by Knudsen diffusion. The occurrence of Knudsen diffusion in the membrane concluded that the PTFE-Nafion membrane has an ability to separate H2 from N-2, CO and CO2. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The electronic properties of the bulk material and two different diameter nanowires were calculated. Moreover, the molecules involved in adsorption were carbon monoxide, methanol, oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The results showed that the high adsorption energy produced is primarily the result of the adsorption of methanol, followed by that of hydrogen peroxide, carbon monoxide and oxygen. The negative adsorption energies obtained showed that the adsorption reactions Were exothermic, and only oxygen was stable. Therefore, a new surface model was described where cobalt atoms were adsorbed on tungsten atoms on the surface of a 12 angstrom nanowire.

The algae were established into culture using standard marine media (f/2 media) and the variation of fatty acid for each species was determined using GCMS. Statistical analysis of one-way ANOVA was performed to evaluate the significant and homogeneity data on the growth of each alga and total fatty acid percentage obtained. The results showed that four taxa were successfully cultivated and identified as Chaetoceros baculites, Chaetoceros anastomosans, Chaetoceros affinis var. willei and Chaetoceros affinis var. affinis. Out of four Chaetoceros, C. baculites showed the highest growth rate (0.75 cell. day-1) and division's value (1.08) while C. anastomosans showed the highest doubling time value (8.66). Statistical analysis showed that all species have significantly different growth rate (p< 0.05). Myristic acid was the main component for fatty acid storage for C. baculites, C. anastomosans and C. affinis var. willei whereas palmitic acid for C. affinis var. affinis. All species contained about 35 to 75% of total percentage fatty acids throughout the growth day. Based on total percentage, both affinis varieties had high fatty acid percentage compared with the other two species with the total percentage of more than 70%. As a conclusion, all four taxa are suitable to be used in lipid industry in Malaysia with C. affinis var. affinis is the best candidate for bio-fuel industry and C. anastomosans for pharmaceutical industry.","[Fuad, M.

In this study, nano-sized TiO2 powders with different particle sizes were used to prepare ceramic hollow fiber membranes. In a series of preparation steps, a dispersant was dissolved in organic solvent before the addition of ceramic powders. These steps were followed by the addition of polymer binder. The membrane precursor was obtained by extruding the ceramic suspension into a coagulation bath, which enabled the precipitation of the precursor of ceramic hollow fiber membrane. The dried precursor was later sintered at temperatures ranging from 1200 to 1300 degrees C to obtain TiO2 hollow fiber membrane. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the morphology of TiO2 hollow fiber membrane. The SEM images show the membrane can be shaped into asymmetric structure and symmetric structure based on the ceramic suspension compositions. The highest mechanical strength obtained was 223 MPa when the membrane prepared using 20 wt. % ceramic loading of single nano-sized powder and sintered at 1300 degrees C. TiO2 hollow fiber membrane prepared using similar ceramic loading showed high permeation rate of inert gas. High pure water fluxes were obtained when permeability tests was carried out using TiO2 hollow fiber membrane, prepared using mixture of nano-sized particles, even though its cross-section have a sponge-like structure.","[Rahman, Mukhlis A.; Ghazali, Mohd Akmal; Abd Aziz, Wan Muhammad Solehin Wan; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan; Jaafar, Juhana; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Petr & Renewable Energy Engn, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr, Skudai 81310, Johor Darul Tak, Malaysia","Rahman, MA (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Petr & Renewable Energy Engn, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr, Skudai 81310, Johor Darul Tak, Malaysia.",r-mukhlis@utm.my,"Jaafar, Juhana/J-8353-2012; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi/D-2643-2012; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan/J-8230-2015","Jaafar, Juhana/0000-0002-7245-8155; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi/0000-0003-0150-625X; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan/0000-0002-5842-2447","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation Malaysia (MOSTI), Malaysia under Sciencefund program [R.J130000.7942.4S031]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under Research University Grant [Q.J130000.2542.03H15, Q.J130000.2509.05H68]","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation Malaysia (MOSTI), Malaysia under Sciencefund program (Project Number: R.J130000.7942.4S031) and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under Research University Grant (Project Number: Q.J130000.2542.03H15 and Q.J130000.2509.05H68).

The PEDOT coating improved the electrochemical characteristics and electron transfer capabilities of the anodes. They also contributed for enhanced MFC performances with maximum energy generation along with coulombic efficiency than the unmodified anodes. The morphological characteristics like higher surface area and open structure of felt material promoted both microbial formation and electrochemical active area. A maximum current density of 3.5 A/m(2) was achieved for GF-P with CE and COD of 51% and 86% respectively.

The rGO/MWCNTs/NF composite material shows specific capacitance of 81.14 F g(-1) at current density of 1 A g(-1) and excellent cycling stability with 83 % of its initial capacitance after 1000 charge/discharge cycles.","[Ban, Fook Yun; Jayabal, Subramaniam; Pandikumar, Alagarsamy; Huang, Nay Ming] Univ Malaya, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Low Dimens Mat Res Ctr, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Lim, Hong Ngee] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Chem, Fac Sci, Upm Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Lim, Hong Ngee] Univ Putra Malaysia, Funct Device Lab, Inst Adv Technol, Upm Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia","Huang, NM (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Low Dimens Mat Res Ctr, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",huangnayming@gmail.com,"Lim, HN/C-4927-2011; Alagarsamy, Pandikumar/D-6811-2011; Alagarsamy, Pandikumar/AAG-4582-2019; Jayabal, Subramaniam/J-3955-2013; Huang, NM/C-2423-2009","Lim, HN/0000-0003-2436-8953; Alagarsamy, Pandikumar/0000-0002-8804-5195; Alagarsamy, Pandikumar/0000-0002-8804-5195; Jayabal, Subramaniam/0000-0003-2055-0686; ","University of Malaya Research Grant UMRG Programme [RP007C/13AFR]; Science Fund from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation [06-01-04-SF1513]; High Impact Research Grant from the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia [UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOHE/05]","This work was financially supported by a University of Malaya Research Grant UMRG Programme (RP007C/13AFR), the Science Fund from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (06-01-04-SF1513), and a High Impact Research Grant from the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia (UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOHE/05).",,52,5,5,0,85,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1868-2529,1868-5994,,ELECTROCATALYSIS-US,Electrocatalysis,JUL,2015,6,4,,,,,373,381,,10.1007/s12678-015-0254-1,,,9,"Chemistry, Physical; Electrochemistry",Chemistry; Electrochemistry,CK9CG,WOS:000356537400006,,,,,1/2/2021,

It determines the ability of the electrode to transport charge to/from reaction sites to the current collector and electrolyte. In this paper, the validity of the recently proposed 3D resistor network model for the prediction of effective conductivity, the ResNet model, is investigated by comparison to experimental data. The 3D microstructures of Ni/10ScSZ anodes are reconstructed using tomography through the focused ion beam and scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) technique. This is used as geometric input to the ResNet model to predict the effective conductivities, which are then compared against the experimentally measured values on the same electrodes. Good agreement is observed, supporting the validity of the ResNet model for predicting the effective conductivity of SOFC electrodes. The ResNet model is then combined with the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method to integrate the description of the local conductivity (electronic and ionic) in the prediction of electrochemical performance. The results show that the electrochemical performance is in particular sensitive to the ionic conductivity of the electrode microstructure, highlighting the importance of an accurate description of the local ionic conductivity.

This was established by determination of initial polymerisation rate (r (p0)), characteristic radical recombination rate (gamma) and delay time (t (0)). The orders of the dependence of the initial rate of grafting on the absorbed dose and monomer concentration were found to be 2.28 and 3.49, respectively. The effect of temperature was investigated in the range of 50-70 A degrees C and the activation energy was determined. The incorporation of poly(4-VP) grafts and the accompanied chemical changes in the grafted ETFE films were monitored using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. The results of the present study showed that a quantitative kinetic description for grafting of 4-VP onto ETFE can be established and the degree of grafting can be tuned by controlling the reaction parameters.","[Sithambaranathan, Paveswari; Nasef, Mohamed Mahmoud; Ahmad, Arshad] Inst Hydrogen Econ, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia; [Nasef, Mohamed Mahmoud] Malaysia Japan Int Inst Technol, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia","Nasef, MM (corresponding author), Malaysia Japan Int Inst Technol, Jalan Semarak, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia.",mahmoudeithar@cheme.utm.my,"Ahmad, Arshad/G-1987-2012; Ahmad, Arshad/H-4639-2015","Ahmad, Arshad/0000-0002-5322-0088; Ahmad, Arshad/0000-0002-0270-0735",Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education under LRGS program [4L817],The author wishes to acknowledge the financial support from the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education under the LRGS program (vote # 4L817).,,35,4,4,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0236-5731,1588-2780,,J RADIOANAL NUCL CH,J.

The main component comprised a novel tubular combustor that is designed to operate on several mixtures of gravity-fed liquid fuels and is integrated into an array of gallium antimonide (GaSb) TPV cells. Four mixtures of kerosene-vegetable cooking oil (VCO) were prepared and evaluated, as follows: 100% kerosene (100 kerosene), 90%/10% kerosene-VCO (90/10 KVCO), 75%/25% kerosene-VCO (75/25 KVCO), and 50%/50% kerosene-VCO (50/50 KVCO). The fuel-air equivalence ratios were varied from the rich blow-off condition to the lean region, and the corresponding electrical output and combustion characteristics were assessed. The maximum electrical efficiency of 1.03% was achieved using 50/50 KVCO, but the maximum radiant efficiency of 31.5% was obtained by using 100 kerosene. Experimental results indicated that increased fuel-air equivalence ratio adversely affected thermal efficiency. However, this shortcoming offsets the achievement of radiant power and efficiency. The thermal efficiency peaked at around stoichiometric mixture for all tested fuel blends. The combustion characteristics of the burner were clarified by analyzing the axial temperature profiles and emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The temperature at the surface of the porous alumina was significantly higher than the developed flame temperature and the temperature at the exit of the burner. The CO emission fluctuated between 220 and 380 ppm in the lean region, but appreciably increased as the fuel-air equivalence ratio was gradually enriched. The NOx emission reflected the pattern of the temperature at the burner exit, and the values recorded were in the range of 6-31 ppm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Mustafa, K.

This approach can be used to revive reversed MFCs, as a supporting assistance current is applied through an assistance anode when voltage reversal occurs. However, when the assistance current is applied without control over the assistance current, voltage reversal is regenerated. Therefore, to control the assistance current, the suggested approach is complemented by the application of variable resistors between the anode and assistance electrode. As a result, the regenerated voltage reversal is restored and all voltages of MFC units in the stacked MFC remain positive. Thus, it is expected that this approach could resolve voltage reversal that occurs in series-connected MFCs, and thus increase the applicability of MFC technology to the production of practically usable electricity, with potential for extension to large-scale MFCs.","[Kim, Bongkyu; Chang, In Seop] GIST, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Gwangju 500712, South Korea; [Lee, Byung-Geun] GIST, Sch Mechatron, Gwangju 500712, South Korea; [Kim, Byung Hong] UKM, Natl Univ Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Kim, Byung Hong] Harbin Inst Technol, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Kim, Byung Hong] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Water Environm & Remediat Res Ctr, Bioelectrochem Lab, Taejon, South Korea","Kim, B (corresponding author), GIST, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, 261 Cheomdan Gwagiro, Gwangju 500712, South Korea.",ischang@gist.ac.kr,,"Chang, In Seop/0000-0001-5064-7951",National Research Foundation (NRF) - Korean government (MSIP) [NRF-2013R1A2A2A0314551],This work was supported by a National Research Foundation (NRF) grant (NRF-2013R1A2A2A0314551) funded by the Korean government (MSIP).,,26,22,22,0,28,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"BOSCHSTRASSE 12, D-69469 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",2196-0216,,,CHEMELECTROCHEM,ChemElectroChem,May-13,2015,2,5,,,,,755,760,,10.1002/celc.201402388,,,6,Electrochemistry,Electrochemistry,CH9QM,WOS:000354370900017,,,,,1/2/2021,

The model takes into account the heat and mass transfers of various reacting gas species. Yuh and Selman's model is implemented to solve the voltage current relationship. In addition, water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is also included in the model. The simulation result is validated with published experimental data. The model is used to study the effects of steady and pulsating flows on the temperature gradients of MCFC electrodes in a shut-down event. Co-flow and counter-flow of MCFC are included in this study. The results show that higher thermal conductivity and smaller gas temperature difference before and after shut down event ensure better structural integrity of the fuel cell. In addition, under the simulated condition, the counter-flow operating condition is better for MCFC due to its overall lower temperature and also temperature gradients. In the case of the pulsating flow, the change of electrode temperature gradient is greater in co-flow MCFC compared to that of counter-flow MCFC. The sinusoidal profile of an electrode temperature gradient is more visible when both anode and cathode gas channels are subject to pulsation. A steady gas flow ensures a lower maximum temperature gradient in an electrode. Nevertheless, the simulation result also shows that under certain pulsating flow conditions, the cathode electrode will have a lower average temperature magnitude compared to that of steady-flow.

Electrical currents were steadily generated at an average level of 0.6mA (or 0.024mA cm(-2) of membrane area) in reactors initially inoculated with microbial sources and operated with 20mM Fe2+ as the sole electron donor and 10ohm external resistance; whereas in an uninoculated reactor (the control), the average current level only reached 0.2mA (or 0.008mAcm(-2) of membrane area). In an inoculated MFC, the generation of electrical currents was correlated with increases in cell density of bacteria in the anode suspension and coupled with the oxidation of ferrous iron. Cultivation-based and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses both show the dominance of some Pseudomonas species in the anode communities of the MFCs. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization results revealed significant increases of neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria in the anode community of an inoculated MFC. The results, altogether, prove the successful development of a lithotrophic MFC system with iron bacteria enriched at its anode and suggest a chemolithotrophic anode reaction involving some Pseudomonas species as key players in such a system. The system potentially offers unique applications, such as accelerated bioremediation or on-site biodetection of iron and/or manganese in water samples.","[Thuy Thu Nguyen; Tha Thanh Thi Luong; Phuong Hoang Nguyen Tran; Ha Thi Viet Bui; Huy Quang Nguyen; Hai The Pham] Vietnam Natl Univ, Univ Sci, Ctr Life Sci Res, Res Grp Physiol & Applicat Microorganisms PHAM Gr, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Ha Thi Viet Bui; Hai The Pham] Vietnam Natl Univ, Univ Sci, Fac Biol, Dept Microbiol, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Huy Quang Nguyen] Vietnam Natl Univ, Univ Sci, Fac Biol, Dept Biochem, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Hang Thuy Dinh] Vietnam Natl Univ, Inst Microbiol & Biol, Lab Microbial Ecol, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Kim, Byung Hong] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Seoul 136791, South Korea; [Kim, Byung Hong] Natl Univ Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Ukm 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Kim, Byung Hong] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Municipal & Environm Engn, Harbin 150090, Peoples R China","Pham, HT (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ, Univ Sci, Ctr Life Sci Res, Res Grp Physiol & Applicat Microorganisms PHAM Gr, Nguyen Trai 334, Hanoi, Vietnam.",phamthehai@vnu.edu.vn,,,Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)National Foundation for Science & Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [106.03-2012.06]; Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) IRDA Alumni Program; International Foundation for Science (IFS - Sweden)International Foundation for Science,This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 106.03-2012.06.

Nano-powders SM0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) and NiO were mixed using a high-energy ball mill, followed by the co-pressing technique at a compaction pressure of 400 MPa. No binder was used between the layers. The electrical behaviors of all sintered samples were studied using electrochemical impedance spectra in the frequency range of 0.01-10(5) Hz under 97% H-2-3% H2O, an amplitude of 10 mV, and at high temperature range of 600-800 degrees C. Results indicate that the non-symmetrical NiO-SDC/SDC anode achieved through microwave sintering has finer grain size and higher electrochemical performance.

In this work, SPEEK membranes with different degrees of sulfonation (DSs) (60% to 76%) and blended with charged surface modifying macromolecule (cSMM) were used as electrolytes in an MFC for simultaneous electricity generation and wastewater treatment. RESULTSPerformance evaluation of newly fabricated membranes was carried out and was compared with that of Nafion 117. The MFC with SPEEK76/cSMM generated about 16.5% higher maximum power density (172.1 mW m(-2)) than that with Nafion 117 (143.7 mW m(-2)). In addition, the SPEEK76/cSMM exhibited the highest coulombic efficiency (CE) of 17.6%, which was 21.6% higher than that of Nafion 117 (13.8%). Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of all characterized membranes was above 80% in our particular MFC. CONCLUSIONMFC is a suitable method for simultaneous wastewater treatment and electricity generation. SPEEK76/cSMM is a promising membrane to be applied in MFC.

In this study, a single tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with an electrolyte of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia 8 mol% ceramic powder was experimentally investigated. The investigation illustrated the effects of three different fuel flow-rates (175 ml/min, 250 ml/min and 325 ml/min) and two operating temperatures (650 degrees C and 750 degrees C) on the output electrical and thermal powers. The highest electrical voltage (open circuit) and overall output power of the cell were found to be 1.1 V and 5.30 W respectively for the fuel flow-rate of 250 ml/min at the operating temperature of 750 degrees C. The electrical power and efficiency were increased about 18.80% and 1.27% respectively for the increase of operating temperature from 650 degrees C to 750 degrees C for a constant fuel flow-rate of 250 ml/min, where; thermal power and efficiency were increased about 33.33% and 10.51% respectively for the same condition. The overall efficiencies of the fuel cell were obtained about 80.42%, 77.49% and 60.73% for the fuel flow-rates of 175 ml/min, 250 ml/min and 325 ml/min respectively for the operating temperatures of 650 degrees C. On the other hand, the overall efficiency of the cell was found to be 83.38% at the operating temperature of 750 degrees C and fuel flow-rate of 250 ml/min. The investigation recommends that for achieving higher efficiency, fuel flow-rate should be lower and operating temperature should be higher. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Ullah, K.

Because of its catabolic properties, R. erythropolis strains are proposed as anti-biofouling agents against NAHL-dependent biofilms, biocontrol agents against NAHL-emitting plant pathogens, and bioremediation agents in contaminated waters and soils. Here, we used the PacBio technology to resolve the complete genome sequence of the biocontrol strain R. erythropolis R138. Its genome consisted in a circular chromosome (6,236,862 bp), a linear plasmid pLRE138 (477,915 bp) and a circular plasmid pCRE138 (91,729 bp). In addition, draft genomes of five R. erythropolis strains were determined by Illumina technology and compared with the other five R. erythropolis genomes that are available in public databases: 5,825 common CDSs were present in all of the eleven analyzed genomes and represented up to 87 % of those identified in R. erythropolis R138. This study highlighted the high proportion of core-genome genes in R. erythropolis, but a high variability of the plasmid content. Key-metabolic pathways which are involved in the degradation of complex molecules, such as NAHLs and phenol, catechol and sterol derivatives are coded by the R. erythropolis core-genome.","[Kwasiborski, Anthony; Mondy, Samuel; Faure, Denis] Univ Paris 11, Univ Paris Saclay, Inst Integrat Biol Cell, I2BC,Saclay Plant Sci,UMR9198,CNRS,CEA, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Chong, Teik-Min; Chan, Kok-Gan] Univ Malaya, Inst Biol Sci, Div Genet & Mol Biol, Fac Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Beury-Cirou, Amelie] CNPPT, SIPRE, F-62217 Achicourt, France; [Faure, Denis] CNRS, Inst Sci Vegetal, UPR2355, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France","Faure, D (corresponding author), CNRS, Inst Sci Vegetal, UPR2355, 1 Ave Terrasse, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",denis.faure@isv.cnrs-gif.fr,"Kok Gan Chan, FASc/B-8347-2010; Chong, Teik Min/L-2999-2016; Mondy, Samuel/AAG-8805-2019","Kok Gan Chan, FASc/0000-0002-1883-1115; Mondy, Samuel/0000-0002-9203-6398","region Ile-de-France (ASTREA)Region Ile-de-France; CNRSCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [SVSE7 2011 ECORUM]; High Impact Research Grant [UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOHE/CHAN/14/1, H-50001-A000027]; French Embassy in Malaysia","This work has benefited from the facilities and expertise of the high throughput sequencing platforms of IMAGIF (Gif-sur-Yvette).

Initially, this study describes the improvement of the mathematical MEC model for hydrogen production from wastewater in a fed-batch reactor. The model, which was modified from an already existing model, is based on material balance with the integration of bioelectrochemical reactions describing the steady-state behavior of biomass growth, consumption of substrates, hydrogen production, and the effect of applied voltage on the performance of the MEC fed-batch reactor. Another goal of this work is to implement a suitable control strategy to optimize the production of biohydrogen gas by selecting the optimal current and applied voltage to the MEC. Various simulation tests involving multiple set-point changes, disturbance rejection, and noise effects were performed to evaluate the performance where the proposed proportional-integral-derivative control system was tuned with an adaptive gain technique and compared with the Ziegler-Nichols method. The simulation results show that optimal tuning can provide better control effect on the MEC system, where optimal H-2 gas production for the system was achieved.

Hybrid cascaded H-bridge topology is used to achieve inverter voltage vector composed of 5-level of voltage. Although DTC is very popular for its simplicity but it suffers from some disadvantages like- high torque ripple and uncontrollable switching frequency. To compensate these shortcomings conventional DTC strategy is modified for five levels voltage source inverter (VSI). Multilevel hysteresis controller for both flux and torque is used. Optimal voltage vector selection from precise lookup table utilizing 12 sector, 9 torque level and 4 flux level is proposed to improve DTC performance. These voltage references are produced utilizing a hybrid cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter, where inverter each phase can be realized using multiple dc source. Fuel cells, car batteries or ultra-capacitor are normally the choice of required dc source.

This study deals with the dual chamber MFCs to increase the power generation using the controlled inoculum in Palm oil mill effluent (POME). Controlled inoculum (CI) was made using the predominant microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Azospira oryzae, Acetobacter peroxydans and Solimonas variicoloris isolated from palm oil anaerobic sludge (AS) as well as from biofilm of MFC anode operated with AS and identified using BIOLOG gene III analysis, PCR, DGGE and sequencing. Biofilm formation on electrode was investigated by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Thermogravimetric analayis (TGA). The MFC operated with Polyacrylonitrile carbon felt (PACF) anode and CI reached the maximum power density of 107.35 mW/m(2), which was two times higher as compared to MFC operated with usual anaerobic sludge as inoculum. The maximum coulombic efficiency (CE) of 74% was achieved from the MFC with CI, which was 50% higher than the CE with anaerobic sludge. But, it showed lower COD removal efficiency of about 32%, which might be due to the absence of required fermentative microorganisms in CI to utilize POME. The electrochemical activities have been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS and the simulated results showed the significant reduction of charge transfer resistance (R-ct) by similar to 40% during the operation of the cell with CI. EIS results provided evidence that there was a substantial improvement in electron transfer between the microorganisms and the anode with CI. These results demonstrate that the power output of MFCs can be increased significantly using CI. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, new findings on ratio of thermal conductivities and electrical conductivities of nanofluids in water: ethylene glycol (EG) mixtures are established. Thermal conductivities and electrical conductivities of base fluids which are water: EG mixtures with concentration ranging from 0 % ethylene glycol up to 100 % ethylene glycol were measured. These base fluids are then dispersed with Al2O3 at 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 % of volume concentration and thermal conductivities and electrical conductivities are then measured at temperature of 20 degrees C. The result demonstrates that thermal conductivities reduced as the EG content percentage increases in the water: EG mixture. Thermal conductivities for 0.5 %volume concentration of Al2O3 is 0.6478 W/m.K and 02816 W/m.K for 0 and 100% EG content in water: EG mixture. However, at a specific EG percentage, thermal conductivities also increased as a function of volume concentration. Electrical conductivities measured in 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 %volume concentration of Al2O3 in base fluid also observed to decrease as the EG concentration increased even though the base fluids' electrical conductivity behave differently. Thermo-electrical conductivity ratio (TEC) has also been established based on both thermal and electrical conductivity findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Azmi, W.

However, pure Pt is poisoned by carbon monoxide, which is an intermediate reaction product in fuel cell systems. Although PtRu alloys are considered to be promising anodic catalysts for commercial direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC), they are limited by slow reaction kinetics, which reduces the performance of the fuel cells and increases cost. Thus, the main objective of this study is to investigate the addition of potential metals to PtRu, specifically, nickel, Ni, and iron, Fe, to improve the reaction kinetics. This study analyzes the nano-catalyst structures using Materials Studio DMol3. The adsorption energy, free energy, vibrational frequencies and total electronic charge density were also calculated as a function of ground-state properties using the density functional theory (DFT). The simulation results indicate that PtRuNiFe has the potential to improve the performance of the catalyst due to the lower calculated adsorption energies and the presence of Fe2+ and Ni2+ ions, which increases the electron density. Finally, this study concludes that PtRuFeNi/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) shows a comparable performance to PtRu. However, it is observed that PtRuFeNi/MWCNT is more stable and has a higher reaction rate than PtRu. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Basri, S.; Kamarudin, S. K.; Daud, W. R.

However, detailed analyses on the performance and emission aspects of the porous burner are lacking. In addition, physical integration between the burner and TE modules has added further complexity in this research area. Thus, this work aims to comprehend the effects of fuel air equivalence ratio on the performance and emission characteristics of a liquid fuel-fired porous burner for micro-cogeneration of TE power. A catalytically inert Al2O3 porous medium was incorporated into a liquid fuel-fired porous burner operating on four mixtures of kerosene-vegetable cooking oil (VCO) blends: 100 kerosene, 90/10 KVCO, 75/25 KVCO, and 50/50 KVCO. Ten bismuth-telluride TE cells were arranged in a ten-sided polygon that, together with finned dissipators, formed a TE module electrically connected in series but thermally connected in parallel. The performance aspects at various fuel air equivalence ratios were thoroughly evaluated with the corresponding temperature profiles, voltage, current, power output, and electrical efficiency. Results indicated that the surface temperature of the porous media was generally higher than the developed and exit flame temperature of the burner. Varying the fuel-air equivalence ratio significantly affected the electrical efficiency, with a maximum and minimum value of 1.94% and 1.10%, respectively. The power output steadily increased in the lean region, but stabilized as the fuel-air equivalence ratio slowly increased beyond the stoichiometric ratio. The CO emission was relatively lower at the lean region; however, significant amount was recorded in the rich combustion region. Moreover, NOx fluctuated between 1 ppm and 4 ppm over the entire range of fuel-air equivalence ratio. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Mustafa, K.

The results showed that at lower COD such as 2000 mg/1, Nafion 117 has the highest performance in terms of power production and COD removal, while once the COD of wastewater goes up to 5000 mg/1, SP/CC/TAP has approximately the same performance as Nafion 117. The membranes were characterized by FESEM, while the degree of sulfonation was measured by NMR. The oxidation activity of microorganisms was measure by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Also, the attachment of bacteria onto the anode electrode was observed by SEM, which showed that different bacteria from the media with a mixed culture inoculum had attached to the anode electrode.

Complex (1) has been examined by melting point, elemental analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The thermal decomposition behavior of the complex has been explored by thermogravimetric, derivative thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric analyses which reveal that complete conversion of (1) into 1 : 1.5 composite oxides, CuO : ZrO2, treated at 500 center dot C. The ability of complex (1) to act as a single-source precursor for the formation of advanced composite oxides thin film has been investigated by aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition at 550 center dot C in air ambient. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analyses of the developed thin films suggest the formation of good quality crystalline microspherical-shaped CuO-1.5ZrO(2) composite oxide with high purity. The electrocatalytic activity of CuO-1.5ZrO(2) composite oxide film was studied toward methanol oxidation in an alkaline medium and it showed high oxidation peak current of 14 mA during a forward scan which is similar to 3.5-fold higher than the bare Pt electrode.

In this study, we investigated the possibility of using such lithotrophic iron-oxidizing MFC (LIO-MFC) systems as biosensors to monitor iron and manganese in water samples. When operated with anolytes containing only ferrous iron as the sole electron donor, the experimented LIO-MFCs generated electrical currents in response to the presence of Fe2+ in the anolytes. For the concentrations of Fe2+ in the range of 3-20 mM, a linear correlation between the current and the concentration of Fe2+ could be achieved (r(2) = 0.98). The LIO-MFCs also responded to the presence of Mn2+ in the anolytes but only when the Mn2+ concentration was less than 3 mM. The presence of other metal ions such as Ni2+ or Pb2+ in the anolytes reduced the Fe2+-associated electricity generation of the LIO-MFCs at various levels. Organic compounds, when present at a non-excessive level together with Fe2+ in the anolytes, did not affect the generation of electricity, although the compounds might serve as alternative electron donors for the anode bacteria. The performance of the LIO-MFCs was also affected to different degrees by operational parameters, including surrounding temperature, pH of the sample, buffer strength and external resistance. The results proved the potential of LIO-MFCs as biosensors sensing Fe2+ in water samples with a significant specificity. However, the operation of the system should be in compliance with an optimal procedure to ensure reliable performance.","[Phuong Hoang Nguyen Tran; Tha Thanh Thi Luong; Thuy Thu Thi Nguyen; Hai The Pham] Univ Sci, Vietnam Natl Univ, Res Grp Physiol & Applicat Microorganisms, Ctr Life Sci Res,Fac Biol,PHAM Grp, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Hai The Pham] Univ Sci, Vietnam Natl Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Microbiol, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Huy Quang Nguyen] Univ Sci, Vietnam Natl Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Biochem, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Hop Van Duong] Vietnam Natl Univ, Inst Microbiol & Biol, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Byung Hong Kim] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Seoul 136791, South Korea; [Byung Hong Kim] Natl Univ Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Byung Hong Kim] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Municipal & Environm Engn, Harbin 150090, Peoples R China","Pham, HT (corresponding author), Univ Sci, Vietnam Natl Univ, Res Grp Physiol & Applicat Microorganisms, Ctr Life Sci Res,Fac Biol,PHAM Grp, Nguyen Trai 334, Hanoi, Vietnam.",phamthehai@vnu.edu.vn; hai.phamthe@gmail.com,,,Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)National Foundation for Science & Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [106.03-2012.06]; Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) IRDA Alumni Program; International Foundation for Science (IFS - Sweden)International Foundation for Science [W-5186],This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 106.03-2012.06.

However, the viability of the sintering additive to be implemented in a phase inversion technique is still ambiguous. In this first attempt, lithium was doped into a gadolinium-doped ceria (CGO) crystal structure using the metal nitrate doping method and calcined at four different temperatures, i.e. 140, 300, 500 and 700 degrees C. The prepared Li-doped CGO (Li-CGO) powders were analyzed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption/desorption, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR). Primary results demonstrate that the calcination temperature of the Li-CGO influences the condition of the electrolyte suspension. Li-CGO calcined at 700 degrees C (D-700), as compared with other Li-CGO, possessed a strong interaction between the Li and CGO. The D-700 was then incorporated into the electrolyte flat sheet membrane which was prepared by a phase inversion technique. The membrane was then sintered at different sintering temperatures from 1350 degrees C to 1450 degrees C. In comparison with the unmodified CGO, the morphological results suggest that the Li2O can remarkably promote the densification of CGO at a lower sintering temperature (1400 degrees C). These findings help to promote the use of sintering additives in a ceria-based electrolyte suspension specifically for the phase inversion technique.","[Jamil, Siti Munira; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan; Rahman, Mukhlis A.; Jaafar, Juhana; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi; Mohamed, Mohamad Azuwa] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Utm Johor Bahru 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia","Othman, MHD (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Utm Johor Bahru 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.",hafiz@petroleum.utm.my,"Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi/D-2643-2012; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan/J-8230-2015; Mohamed, Mohamad Azuwa/F-1964-2018","Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi/0000-0003-0150-625X; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan/0000-0002-5842-2447; Mohamed, Mohamad Azuwa/0000-0003-1662-5382; Jamil, Siti Munira/0000-0003-0594-1523","Ministry of Education Malaysia [R.J130000.7842.4L104, R.J130000.7809.4F282]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under Research University Grant Tier 1 [Q.J130000.2509.05H53]","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Ministry of Education Malaysia under Exploratory Research Grant Scheme (Project number: R.J130000.7842.4L104) and Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (Project number: R.J130000.7809.4F282), and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under Research University Grant Tier 1 (Project number: Q.J130000.2509.05H53).

It has been proposed for preventing the reduction of oxygen in the anode compartment of MFC-based biosensors, but has also been found to function as an electron acceptor in recent research. However, there are few reports about the effects of azide on the structure and composition of the microbial community in air-cathode MFCs, as well as on their corresponding performance. Therefore, the current generation, electroactivity and community structure of anodic biofilms were investigated using air-cathode MFCs acclimated with (1.5 mM) and without azide. The enrichment process was much slower in the presence of azide compared to the control. Biofilms enriched with and without azide were found to produce similar voltammograms, but the difference lay in the current intensity of the predominant peaks. Pyrosequencing indicated that the distribution of microbes at the genus level was more uniform, with Geobacter and Ignavibacterium being the dominant genera on both biofilms, although the community of the azide-enriched film was less diverse than that of the control. These results demonstrate that the microbial community enriched with azide was not significantly altered compared to the control and the difference in the maximum current or peak current of cyclic voltammograms (CVs) was thought to be related to the amount of biomass.","[Zhou, Xiangtong; Qu, Youpeng; Kim, Byung Hong; Li, Henan; Liu, Jia; Du, Yue; Li, Da; Dong, Yue; Ren, Nanqi; Feng, Yujie] Harbin Inst Technol, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Kim, Byung Hong] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Water Environm & Remediat Res Ctr, Bioelectrochem Lab, Seoul, South Korea; [Qu, Youpeng] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Kim, Byung Hong] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Malaysia","Feng, YJ (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China.",pp198259@hit.edu.cn; yujief@hit.edu.cn,"LIU, JIA/A-2317-2012; Feng, Yujie/L-9133-2013","LIU, JIA/0000-0001-8334-9547; Feng, Yujie/0000-0002-0686-3937","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [HIT.

Brunauer-Emmett-Teller technique and atomic force microscopy were used to investigate the surface area and surface roughness of the composite materials, respectively. Conductivity measurements using impedance spectroscopy were conducted from 350 degrees C to 550 degrees C. The specific surface area of the pure SDC powder decreased from 8.85 m(2)/g to 4.24 m(2)/g after the carbonate phase was incorporated into the SDC phase with increasing particle size. The composite pellet sintering temperature affected the continuity between the two phases [SDC and (Li/Na) carbonate], roughness, mean particle size, and conductivity of the composite electrolyte. A fully dense SDCC composite electrolyte pellet sintered at 550 degrees C exhibited a maximum ionic conductivity of 0.077 S/cm at 550 degrees C. In addition, 550 degrees C was the minimum sintering temperature to achieve good wetting between the two phases, moderate particle size, low surface roughness, and high ionic conductivity.

The structures and properties of the catalysts were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, XPS, BET, UV-vis and PL spectroscopy. Indium, present over the TiO2 in metal state, inhibited crystal growth and produced anatase phase of mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles. Doping In in TiO2 also increased the surface area and enlarged the band gap. The photocatalytic activities of In-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were considerably improved for CO2 reduction with H2O vapors in a cell type photoreactor. CO was observed as the main product over TiO2, but doping In in TiO2 remarkably increased the CH4 yield. CH4 production rate over 10 wt.% In-doped TiO2 was 7.9-fold higher than the bare TiO2 at 100 degrees C and CO2/H2O ratio of 1.43. In addition, C1-3 higher hydrocarbons namely C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8 were detected in the product mixture. The enhanced photoactivity in mesoporous In-doped TiO2 nanoparticles can be attributed to interfacial transfer of photogenerated charges, which led to effective charge separation and inhibited recombination of photogenerated electron-hole (e(-)/h(+)) pairs.

Better knowledge about the biofilm development process on electrode surface is believed to improve MFC performance. In this study, double-chamber microbial fuel cell was operated with diluted POME (initial COD = 1,000 mg L-1) and polyacrylonitrile carbon felt was used as electrode. The maximum power density, COD removal efficiency and Coulombic efficiency were found as 22 mW m(-2), 70 and 24 %, respectively. FTIR and TGA analysis confirmed the formation of biofilm on the electrode surface during MFC operation. The impact of anode biofilm on anodic polarization resistance was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and microbial community changes during MFC operation using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The EIS-simulated results showed the reduction of charge transfer resistance (R (ct)) by 16.9 % after 14 days of operation of the cell, which confirms that the development of the microbial biofilm on the anode decreases the R (ct) and therefore improves power generation. DGGE analysis showed the variation in the biofilm composition during the biofilm growth until it forms an initial stable microbial community, thereafter the change in the diversity would be less. The power density showed was directly dependent on the biofilm development and increased significantly during the initial biofilm development period. Furthermore, DGGE patterns obtained from 7th and 14th day suggest the presence of less diversity and probable functional redundancy within the anodic communities possibly responsible for the stable MFC performance in changing environmental conditions.","[Baranitharan, E.; Khan, Maksudur R.; Prasad, D.

NOV.; SP. NOV.; NITRIFICATION,"Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) offer a strategy for treating source-separated urine with current generation, but the high content of ammonia is still a challenge for sustainable maintenance of BESs due to ammonia inhibition. Therefore, an integrated BES setup was developed to overcome this problem by ammonia recovery. This setup, working in closed circuit mode with nitrogen purging (CN), allowed for the produced ammonia to be continuously channeled to an absorption bottle. In addition, control reactors in closed circuit (CC) or in open circuit mode (OC) were also run for comparison. A maximum power density of 310.9 +/- 1.0 mW m(-2) was obtained for the CN reactor, and 127.1 +/- 0.9 mW m(-2) was obtained for the CC reactor. Total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency (84.9% +/- 2.2%) from urine was considerably higher in the CN reactor than it was in the CC (29.7% +/- 6.7%) or OC (30.0% +/- 8.2%) reactor. In the CN reactor, 52.8% +/- 3.6% of the TN was recovered in the form of NH3-N, with a NH3 recovery rate of 435.7 +/- 29.6 gN m(-3) d(-1). The improved performance of the CN reactor was attributed to the mitigation of ammonia inhibition to the anode electro-activity. 16S rDNA sequencing showed that no Anammox and nitrifiers were detected on the anodes and cathodes. Overall, nitrogen purging provides the urine-fed BESs with a useful approach for maintaining the system performance by ammonia recovery.","[Zhou, Xiangtong; Kim, Byung Hong; Du, Yue; Wang, Haiman; Li, Henan; Dong, Yue; He, Weihua; Liu, Jia; Feng, Yujie] Harbin Inst Technol, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Qu, Youpeng] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Kim, Byung Hong] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Water Environm & Remediat Res Ctr, Bioelectrochem Lab, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Byung Hong] Natl Univ Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Malaysia","Feng, YJ (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China.",yujief@hit.edu.cn,"LIU, JIA/A-2317-2012; Feng, Yujie/L-9133-2013","LIU, JIA/0000-0001-8334-9547; Feng, Yujie/0000-0002-0686-3937","State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of TechnologyHarbin Institute of Technology [2015DX05]; National Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young ScholarsNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [51125033]; National Natural Science Fund of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51209061, 51408156]; International Cooperating Project [2014DFE90110]","This study was supported by the State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology (Grant No. 2015DX05) and by the National Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (Grant No. 51125033) and the National Natural Science Fund of China Grant No. 51209061 and No. 51408156).

The majority of BPV platforms incorporate indium tin oxide (ITO) anodes for the purpose of charge transfer due to its inherent optical and electrical properties. However, other materials such as reduced graphene oxide (RGO) could provide higher efficiency due to their intrinsic electrical properties and biological compatibility. In this work, the performance of algae biofilms grown on RGO and ITO anodes were measured and discussed.

High resolution SEM and TEM verified the bud-like shape and uniform distribution of the PPy in the KC matrix. X-ray diffraction (XRD) has approved the amorphous structure of the PPy/KC as well. The PPy/KC nano-bio composites were then studied as an electrode material, due to their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) ability as the cathode catalyst in the MFC and the results were compared with platinum (Pt) as the most common cathode catalyst. The produced power density of the PPy/KC was 72.1 mW/m(2) while it was 46.8 mW/m(2) and 28.8 mW/m(2) for MC and PPy individually. The efficiency of the PPy/KC electrode system is slightly lower than a Pt electrode (79.9 mW/m(2)) but due to the high cost of Pt electrodes, the PPy/KC electrode system has potential to be an alternative electrode system for MFCs.

Porous carbon nanofiber (CNF) anode layers were employed in three sets of single passive DMFCs; each membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was run continuously in durability testing for 3000 h. The objective of this study is to investigate the degradation mechanisms in an MEA with a porous CNF anode layer under different modes of operation. The polarization curves of single passive DMFCs before and after durability tests were compared. The degradation of DMFC performance under the cyclic LT1 mode was much more severe than that of L12 and LT3 operation. The loss of maximum power density after degradation tests was 49.5%, 28.4% and 43.7% for LT1, LT2 and LT3, respectively. TEM, SEM and EDS mapping were used to investigate the causes of degradation. The lower power loss for LT2 was mainly attributed to the reversible degradation caused by poor water discharge, which thus reduced the air supply. Catalyst agglomeration was especially observed in LT1 and LT3 and is related to carbon corrosion due to possible fuel starvation. The loss of active catalyst area was a major cause of performance degradation in LT1 and LT3. In addition to this, the dissolution and migration of Ru catalyst from the anode to cathode was identified and correlated with degraded cell performance. In the DMFC, the carbon nanofiber anode catalyst support exhibited higher performance stability with less catalyst agglomeration than the cathode catalyst support, carbon black. This study helps understand and elucidate the failure mechanism of MEAs, which could thus help to increase the lifetime of DMFCs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Zainoodin, A.

The most common method to prepare carbon-based solid acid catalysts is thermal treatment with concentrated sulphuric acid, which is a time-consuming and energy-intensive process. Therefore, the feasibility of other sulphonation methods, such as the in situ polymerisation of acetic anhydride and sulphuric acid, the thermal decomposition of ammonium sulphate and the in situ polymerisation of poly(sodium4-styrenesulphonate), were examined in this study. The esterification reaction was performed at 170 degrees C for 3 h at a methanol to palm fatty acid distillate ratio of 20 and catalyst loading of 2 wt% in a pressurised reactor. The fatty acid methyl esters yields achieved by the sulphonated multi-walled carbon nanotubes prepared via thermal treatment with concentrated sulphuric acid, the in situ polymerisation of acetic anhydride and sulphuric acid, the thermal decomposition of ammonium sulphate and the in situ polymerisation of poly(sodium4-styrenesulphonate) were 78.1%, 85.8%, 88.0% and 93.4%, respectively. All catalysts could maintain a high catalytic activity even during the fifth cycle. Among the sulphonation methods, the in situ polymerisation of poly(sodium4-styrenesulphonate) produced the catalyst with the highest acid group density. In addition, the resonance structures of the benzenesulphonic acid groups attached to the surface of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes generated additional active sites for esterification that led to a higher biodiesel yield.

The role of proton transportation in MFC performance makes PEMs one of the most important components in the cell. The effect of PEMs in MFC performance is commonly determined according to generated power density and coulombic efficiency. Nafion is the commonly used membrane in MFCs, but there are still a number of problems associated with the use of Nafion including oxygen transfer rate, cation transport and accumulation rather than protons, membrane fouling and substrate loss. Moreover, additional problems can also be attributed to the effect of PEMs including internal resistance and pH change in MFCs. Recent developments in PEM performance are attributed to two categories including utilization of other types of membranes and improvements in Nafion by pre-treatment methods.

The quantified nickel-based anode data through the analysis of particle sizes with their metal metal and ceramic ceramic neck sizes, metal ceramic interface sizes, volume fractions, and triple-phase boundary densities, demonstrate it is possible to understand how microstructure contributes to differences observed in electrochemical and mechanical performance; facilitating optimisation of electrode micro/nano structure towards improved performance.

The present investigation focuses on the intensification of transesterification reaction for the generation of biodiesel using palm oil as the feedstock in the presence of KOH as a catalyst. For the first time, a triple frequency ultrasonic reactor (combination of 28-40-70 kHz) has been used for the intensification using palm oil with an objective of reducing the reaction time, molar ratio as well as possibly increasing the yield of biodiesel. The optimized parameters of reaction time, reaction temperature, and the obtained yield (%) in this ultrasound assisted system have been compared with the conventional approach of mechanical stirring. Also, within this ultrasound assisted approach, single, dual and triple frequency modes of operation have been compared to achieve an effective intensification. It has been observed that the cavitation effects were higher for the triple frequency operation as compared to the dual and single frequency operations. The maximum yield of biodiesel obtained with the triple frequency approach, at 3:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil with 1 wt.% potassium hydroxide as catalyst was 93% with a significantly reduced reaction time of 15 min as compared to 3 h required in case of conventional stirring to achieve 75% yield. The results of this investigation support that using multiple frequency ultrasonic irradiation is beneficial in intensifying the transesterification reaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and chitosan (ChiL), both are cationic polymer, are feasible to act as binding agent to promote rapid magnetophoretic separation of Chlorella sp. through low gradient magnetic separation (LGMS) with field gradient del B less than 80 T/m in real time. Cell separation efficiency up to 98% for the case of PDDA and 99% for the case of ChiL can be achieved in 6 min when 3 x 10(7) cells/mL Chlorella sp. are exposed to 300 mg/L surface functionalized-IONPs (SF-IONPs). Different polyelectrolytes do not give significant effect on cell separation efficiency as long as the particle attachment occurred. However, the PDDA is more preferable as the binder for all type of microalgae medium than the chitosan (ChiL) since it is not pH dependent. SF-IONPs coated with PDDA guarantee the cell separation performance for all pH range of cell medium, with 98.21 +/- 0.40% at pH 8.84. On the other hand, the ChiL performance will be affected by the cell medium pH, with only 22.93 +/- 31.03% biomass recovery at pH 9.25. (C) 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the calcination on the microstructure of SDC/YSB bilayered electrolytes in IT-SOFC. Bilayered electrolytes SDC and YSB were syntesised via sol-gel and a solid state reaction method. The SDC powders were calcined at 800, 1000 and 1200 degrees C for 5 h whereas YSB powders were calcined at 550, 650 and 750 degrees C for 2 h. The result from XRD showed that the SDC powder having a Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 structure after the calcine at a temperature of 800 to 1200 degrees C for 5 h and YSB having an Y0.25Bi0.75O1.5 structure at 750 degrees C for 2 h. An increase in the calcination temperature on the SDC at 800, 1000 and 1200 degrees C for 5 h caused an increased in crystalline size to 42.4, 58.7 and 79.9 nm, respectively. An increase in YSB calcination temperature to 750 degrees C resulted in the transformation of YSB from tetragonal into cubic fluorite structure with a crystallite size of 28.86 nm. By comparing the results of cell performance test in intermediate operation temperature (650 degrees C), bilayered electrolytes (SDC/YSB) with the calcination temperature SDC-1200 degrees C and YSB-750 degrees C showed the highest cell performance with power density 81.55 mW/cm(2) and current density of 225.36 mA/cm(2).","[Panuh, Dedikarni; Muchtar, Andanastuti; Muhamad, Norhamidi; Majlan, Edy Herianto; Daud, Wan Ramli Wan] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Sel Fuel, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia","Muchtar, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Sel Fuel, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",muchtar@eng.ukm.my,"Majlan, Edy Herianto/N-9636-2017; Daud, Wan Ramli/B-3635-2013; Muchtar, Andanastuti/E-3806-2017","Majlan, Edy Herianto/0000-0001-9327-7153; Daud, Wan Ramli/0000-0002-1023-456X; Muchtar, Andanastuti/0000-0002-1599-8964; Panuh, Dedikarni/0000-0002-0182-4269",,,,18,2,2,0,12,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,SELANGOR,"FACULTY SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, BANGI, SELANGOR, 43600, MALAYSIA",0126-6039,,,SAINS MALAYS,Sains Malays.,NOV,2014,43,11,,,,,1769,1774,,,,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AU3TA,WOS:000345535300017,,,,,1/2/2021,

However, Pt involved both in the oxidation reaction of methanol and the reduction of oxygen on the cathode side, which limits the performance of DMFCs. Therefore, this study investigates cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) as a potential DMFC cathode catalyst capable of inhibiting the reactivity of methanol oxidation. This study investigates the reaction mechanism and adsorption energy of oxygen molecules on Cobalt Phthalocyanine (CoPc) using the Density Functional Theory (DFT). The basis sets of semi-core pseudopotential (DSPP) and effective core potential are used to compare the geometric optimization of the Cobalt Phthalocyanine structure. The adsorption strength of molecular oxygen on the Cobalt metal center of Phthalocyanine is investigated using Partial Density of States and compared with that of Iron Phthalocyanine (FePc). Finally, the results show that the adsorption energy of carbon monoxide and methanol on the Cobalt and Iron metal centers of the Phthalocyanine complex yield low energy adsorption on CoPc. It was observed that the adsorption energy when two metal sites of CoPc and supported CoPc on tungsten atom are involved yields high energy adsorption and bond length of molecular oxygen that would lead to oxygen bond dissociation. Therefore, this study concludes that CoPc has the potential to replace Pt due to its high tolerance to methanol and carbon monoxide oxidation. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

These MFCs enriched with azide at the concentration higher than 0.5 mM generated lower current and coulomb efficiency (CE) than the control reactors, but at the concentration lower than 0.2 mM MFCs generated higher current and CE. Power density curves showed overshoot at higher azide concentrations, with power and current density decreasing simultaneously. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that azide at high concentration increased the charge transfer resistance. These analyses might reflect that a part of electrons were consumed by the anode microbial population rather than transferred to the anode. Bacterial population analyses showed azide-enriched anodes were dominated by Deltaproteobacteria compared with the controls. Based on these results it is hypothesized that azide can eliminate the growth of aerobic respiratory bacteria, and at the same time is used as an electron acceptor/sink. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Oxygen excess ratio, compressor flow rate and supply manifold pressure are constrained to avoid oxygen starvation, surge and choke phenomena. This is achieved by manipulating compressor voltage and stack current. The choice of the manipulated input to satisfy a constraint is investigated. Surge and choke avoidance is successful, when compressor voltage is manipulated. When stack current is utilized to satisfy surge and choke constraints, a large unrealistic current is needed. Oxygen starvation is successfully avoided utilizing stack current, while compressor voltage manipulation fails to prevent oxygen starvation. Thus, a current governor is implemented to handle oxygen starvation, while the compressor voltage is constrained to avoid surge and choke. Quadratic programming optimization, Laguerre and exponential weight function are employed to reduce the computational burden of the controller. The simulation results prove that the proposed controller managed to satisfy all constraints without any conflict.","[Abdullah, Muhammad; Idres, Moumen] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Mech Engn, Kuala Lumpur 53100, Malaysia","Idres, M (corresponding author), Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Mech Engn, Kuala Lumpur 53100, Malaysia.",midres@iium.edu.my,"Bin Abdullah, Muhammad/P-7893-2019","Bin Abdullah, Muhammad/0000-0002-7118-3698; Idres, Moumen/0000-0001-7784-9051","International Islamic University Malaysia Endowment Fund (EDW) [B11-177-0655]; Ministry of Higher Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia","The authors would like to acknowledge International Islamic University Malaysia Endowment Fund (EDW B11-177-0655), and Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for funding this work.",,21,13,13,1,11,KOREAN SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,SEOUL,"KSTC NEW BLD. 7TH FLOOR, 635-4 YEOKSAM-DONG KANGNAM-KU, SEOUL 135-703, SOUTH KOREA",1738-494X,1976-3824,,J MECH SCI TECHNOL,J.

The design, performance, and efficiency properties of a vehicle are often stated to be some of the key challenges in its commercialization. This paper highlights a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)-powered system of an electric bicycle. The system consists of a 250-W fuel cell, ECU, battery pack, DC/DC converter, electric motor, and other supporting equipment. After introducing the different parts of the bicycle, its overall efficiency will be discussed in great detail. The efficiency of fuel cells is not specific; it is a subordinate to the power density where the system operates. Experimental work has been conducted to measure the values of the efficiency and energy flow. The results indicated a maximum fuel cell efficiency of 63% and an overall system efficiency of 35.4%. The latter value is expressed with regards to the Lower Heating Value (LHV) of hydrogen. All measurements were taken for the cruising conditions of the vehicle and its corresponding to power consumption. The results are superior to those of a standard internal ignition engine. The fuel cell performance is least efficient when functioning under maximum output power conditions. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Electrospun PVDF nanofibres were fabricated using an electrospinning method. The membranes were prepared by combining different amounts of Nafion (0.2 g, 0.4 g, 0.6 g) with high porosity electrospun PVDF nanofibres. The characteristics of the PVDF nanofibres and the membrane, such as morphology, thermal stability, structure and the power generated by the different PEMs, were investigated. Ribbon shaped PVDF nanofibres were preserved in a membrane, as shown by the Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) cross sectional image. Results from Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis show an increase in the thermal stability of the membrane due to the presence of the electrospun PVDF nanofibres. Consequently, the structure of the nanofibres was saved within the membrane. The results show that the membrane prepared using PVDF and 0.4 g Nafion had the highest power generation and coulombic efficiency of all membranes, with 4.9 mW/m2 and 12.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, the membrane prepared using PVDF and 0.2 g Nafion had the lowest power generation of 2.9 mW/m2 and a coulombic efficiency of 4.4%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The slope of steady state current versus voltage is used as a performance marker. A new parameter Delta, which signifies the net moisture transport in PAFC, is introduced and evaluated from the experimental data to locate the regimes of electrolyte dilution and drying. Based on these two parameters, the performance of a PAFC is mapped on the plane of operating variables. Performance decay at higher cell temperature and lower humidifier temperature (below 60 degrees C) signifies acid drying; on the contrary the same at lower cell temperature and higher humidifier temperature is attributed to acid dilution. EIS is employed by imposing a sinusoidal potential excitation on steady state DC load and the shift of maximum phase angle position in the frequency spectrum is used as a diagnostic marker. Results show absence of peak in the domain of positive frequency for acid drying condition, while acid dilution causes the peak to be shifted at higher frequency value. Electrochemical timescales estimated from EIS increases by many order of magnitudes compared to that in a normal PAFC, when electrolyte drying occurs. The results obtained from EIS analysis are in agreement with the performance mapping based on galvanometric steady analysis. The results are significant in context of water management and humidity control in a PAFC. The tools and parameters introduced in the present publication show promising potential to map the performance and SOH of a PAFC on the plane of various operating variables. Results and logics revealed are of significance in development of inferential model for the online optimization of PAFC.","[Paul, Tanmoy] Indian Assoc Cultivat Sci, Dept Phys, Kolkata 700032, India; [Seal, Mrinal; Banerjee, Dipali] Bengal Engn & Sci Univ, Dept Phys, Sibpur 711103, W Bengal, India; [Ganguly, Saibal] Univ Technol Petronas UTP, Dept Chem Engn, Perak Darul Ridzuan 31750, Tronoh, Malaysia; [Kargupta, Kajari] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Kolkata 700032, India; [Sandilya, Pavitra] IIT Kharagpur, Cryogen Engn Dept, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India","Kargupta, K (corresponding author), Jadavpur Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Kolkata 700032, India.",paultanmoy00@gmail.com; mrinal.phy@gmail.com; dipalibanerjeebesu@gmail.com; gangulysaibal2011@gmail.com; karguptakajari2011@gmail.com; profsandilya@gmail.com,"Paul, Tanmoy/AAC-7788-2021; Banerjee, Dipali/AAB-7353-2019","Paul, Tanmoy/0000-0002-2258-3951; ","NMRL, DRDO, Ministry of Defense, India","This work is partially supported by sponsored project from NMRL, DRDO, Ministry of Defense, India.",,28,5,5,0,39,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",1550-624X,1551-6989,,J FUEL CELL SCI TECH,J.

In this work, the effects of partial substitution of both cerium and aluminum on the hydrogenation properties of La((0.65-x)Ce(x)Ca(1.03)Mg(1.32)Ni((9-y))Aly alloys were investigated simultaneously using factorial design. Both Ce and Al additions greatly improved the reversibility of hydrogen storage capacity. However, the maximum hydrogen storage capacity and absorption kinetics can be reduced by the additions.

In addition, air and oxygen were used to investigate the effect of oxidant flow rate on DFAFC performance and fuel crossover by operating the DFAFC under three modes of reactant supply: passive, semi passive (oxidant supplied), and active (both oxidant and fuel supplied). Fuel crossover was determined by measuring the percentage of exhausted carbon dioxide (CO2) at the cathode using a CO2 analyzer, from which the equivalent formic acid crossover flux was calculated. The results indicate that the DFAFC performance and fuel crossover were affected by formic acid concentration, temperature, humidity, oxidant flow rate, and the mode of operation. Optimums of these operating parameters were established for obtaining high performance of the DFAFC. The relationships between these parameters and the performance and fuel crossover of the DFAFC are discussed in this paper. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The power density reached 145 mW/m(2) with an initial rice straw concentration of 1 g/L; while the coulombic efficiencies (CEs) ranged from 54.3 to 45.3%, corresponding to initial rice straw concentrations of 0.5-1 g/L. Stackable MFCs in series and parallel produced an open circuit voltage of 2.17 and 0.723 V, respectively, using hexacyanoferrate as the catholyte. The maximum power for serial connection of three stacked MFCs was 490 mW/m(2) (0.5 mA). In parallelly stacked MFCs, the current levels were approximately 3-fold (1.5 mA) higher than those produced from the serial connection. These results demonstrated that electricity can be produced from rice straw by exploiting CDB as the biocatalyst. Thus, this method provides a promising way to utilize rice straw for bioenergy production. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Ethanol fermentation using glycerol as carbon source was carried out by local isolate, ethanologenic bacterium Escherichia coli SS1 in a close system. Factors affecting bioethanol production from pure glycerol were optimized via response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design (CCD). Four significant variables were found to influence bioethanol yield; initial pH of fermentation medium, substrate concentration, salt content and organic nitrogen concentration with statistically significant effect (p < 0.05) on bioethanol production. The significant factor was then analyzed using central composite design (CCD). The optimum conditions for bioethanol production were substrate concentration at 34.5 g/L, pH 7.61, and organic nitrogen concentration at 6.42 g/L in which giving ethanol yield approximately 1.00 mol/mol. In addition, batch ethanol fermentation in a 2 L bioreactor was performed at the glycerol concentration of 20 g/L, 35 g/L and 45 g/L, respectively. The ethanol yields obtained from all tested glycerol concentrations were approaching theoretical yield when the batch fermentation was performed at optimized conditions.

Their successful application requires minimization of thermal and electrical contact resistance between components. The current study investigates the evolution of both resistances with increasing compressive force between metallic foam and graphite plates. Reducing these contact resistances through compressive force instead of brazing significantly reduces the manufacturing cost. Our results show that both electrical and thermal resistances monotonically decrease with increasing compressive force when moving from no compressive force to a slight one about 100 N (corresponding to a compressive stress of 0.01 MPa). Interestingly, compared with the thermal contact resistance, the electrical contact resistance shows more sensitivity to compressive force within this range of force. Furthermore, it has been noted that increases in compressive force beyond 300 N (i.e. 0.03 MPa) decrease the resistances only marginally. Electrical contact resistance was found to govern the total resistance of the metal foam-graphite assembly since electric bulk resistances are several orders of magnitude lower. Similar observations are made for thermal resistance where the minimum contact resistance exceeds the thermal resistance of the foam in our experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Model predictive control is a prime candidate for its optimization and constraint handling features. In this work, an improved model predictive control (MPC) with Laguerre and exponential weight functions is proposed to control fuel cell oxygen starvation problem. To get the best performance of MPC, the control and prediction horizons are selected as large as possible within the computation limit. An exponential weight function is applied to place more emphasis on the current time and less emphasis on the future time in the optimization process. This leads to stable numerical solution for large prediction horizons. Laguerre functions are used to capture most of the control trajectory, while reducing the controller computation time and memory for large prediction horizons. Robustness and stability of the proposed controller are assessed using Monte-Carlo simulations. Results verify that the modified MPC is able to mimic the performance of the infinite horizon controller, discrete linear quadratic regulator (DLQR). The controller computation time is reduced approximately by one order of magnitude compared to traditional MPC scheme. Results from Monte-Carlo simulations prove that the proposed controller is robust and stable up to system parameters uncertainty of 40%.","[Abdullah, Muhammad; Idres, Moumen] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Mech Engn, Kuala Lumpur 53100, Malaysia","Idres, M (corresponding author), Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Mech Engn, Kuala Lumpur 53100, Malaysia.",midres@iium.edu.my,"Bin Abdullah, Muhammad/P-7893-2019","Bin Abdullah, Muhammad/0000-0002-7118-3698; Idres, Moumen/0000-0001-7784-9051","International Islamic University Malaysia Endowment Fund [EDW B11-117-0655]; Management Service Division International Islamic University Malaysia; Ministry of Higher Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia","The author would like to acknowledge International Islamic University Malaysia Endowment Fund (EDW B11-117-0655), Management Service Division International Islamic University Malaysia and Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for funding this work.",,24,12,14,0,18,KOREAN SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,SEOUL,"KSTC NEW BLD. 7TH FLOOR, 635-4 YEOKSAM-DONG KANGNAM-KU, SEOUL 135-703, SOUTH KOREA",1738-494X,1976-3824,,J MECH SCI TECHNOL,J.

During this time, the engine can not work at peak operating temperature. This leads to incomplete combustion and emissions level increase due to having fuel residues in the exhaust. Also, idling results in increase in fuel consumption. The purpose of this study is to evaluate fuel consumption and emissions parameters under high idling conditions when diesel blended with Jatropha curcas biodiesel is used to operate a diesel engine. Although biodiesel diesel blends decrease carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions, they increase nitrogen oxides emissions in high idling modes. Compared to pure diesel fuel, fuel consumption also increases under all high idling conditions for biodiesel -diesel blends, with a further increase occurring as blend percentage rises.

This study thus aimed to determine the feasibility of the electrophoretic deposition technique in producing composite cathode films. Two parameters were investigated, namely, the effects of counter electrode size and those of deposition time on the thickness and quality of an LSCF-SDC carbonate cathode composite deposited onto an SDC carbonate substrate. The effects of the changed parameters were observed by applying constant suspension pH and voltage. Five different deposition times ranging from 10 to 30 min were selected. The counter electrode sizes used were 25 Chi 25 mm(2) and 50 Chi 50 mm(2). Then, the cathode composite films were sintered at 600 degrees C for 90 min. Microstructural characterization and film thickness measurement were performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The 50 Chi 50 mm(2) counter electrode was found to produce a cathode composite film with higher thickness. The effects of the selected parameters (deposition time and counter electrode size) were also determined by analyzing the weight and thickness of the obtained LSCF-SDC carbonate films. The results showed that for the selected time interval, a film thickness of 4.6 to 30.8 mu m is generated. Further studies on fabricating LSCF-SDC carbonate cathode composites by electrophoretic deposition present promising potential given that the film thickness obtained agree well with those derived in previous studies on various types of cathode materials.","[Baharuddin, Nurul Akidah; Abd Rahman, Hamimah; Muchtar, Andanastuti; Sulong, Abu Bakar; Abdullah, Huda] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Sel Fuel, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia","Muchtar, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Sel Fuel, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",muchtar@eng.ukm.my,"Abdullah, Huda/H-9717-2016; Baharuddin, Nurul Akidah/G-2729-2017; Abd.Rahman, Hamimah/N-3563-2016","Baharuddin, Nurul Akidah/0000-0003-1604-8749; Abd.Rahman, Hamimah/0000-0001-5258-3656; Sulong, Abu Bakar/0000-0003-4637-1758; Muchtar, Andanastuti/0000-0002-1599-8964",,,,23,3,4,0,10,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,SELANGOR,"FACULTY SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, BANGI, SELANGOR, 43600, MALAYSIA",0126-6039,,,SAINS MALAYS,Sains Malays.,APR,2014,43,4,,,,,595,601,,,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AG4FV,WOS:000335375600013,,,,,1/2/2021,

The membrane denoted as PVDF- g- 4- VP/ PA was prepared by radiation induced grafting of 4-vinylpyridine (4-VP) onto poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) films followed by doping with PA. The effect of grafting conditions on the degree of grafting (G%) was investigated. The acid doping conditions (G%, time and PA concentration) were also investigated with respect to doping level. The grafted precursors and the acid dopedmembraneswere characterized by means of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X- ray diffractometry (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The membranes showed a thermal stability up to a temperature of similar to 160 degrees C, above which they undergo a multi- step degradation pattern due to decomposition of the protonated functions, poly(4VP) grafts and PVDFmatrix, respectively. The proton conductivities of the membranes were found to increase with the increase in G% (doping level) and the temperature with a maximum proton conductivity of 62mS cm(- 1) achieved at 100 degrees C without any humidification.

The performance of oxide systems for solar energy conversion is briefly considered in terms of an electronic factor. The progress of research in the formation of systems with high performance is considered in terms of specific aspects of nanotechnology, leading to the formation of systems with high performance. The nanotechnology approach in the development of high-performance photocatalysts is considered in terms of the effect of surface energy associated with the formation of nanostructured system on the formation of surface structures that exhibit outstanding properties. The unresolved problems that should be tackled in better understanding of the effect of nanostructures on properties and performance of oxide semiconductors in solar energy conversion are discussed. This part is summarised by a list of unresolved problems of crucial importance in the formation of systems with enhanced performance. This work also formulates the questions that must be addressed in order to overcome the hurdles in the formation of oxide semiconductors with high performance in water purification and the generation of solar fuel. The research strategy in the development of oxide systems with high performance, including photocatalysts for solar water purification and photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting, is considered. The considerations are focused on the systems based on titanium dioxide of different defect disorder as well as its solid solutions and composites.","[Idris, M. A.; Jamal, Z. A. Z.; Jamaludin, S.

Electroless plating was used to deposit Ni onto the inner surfaces of the electrolyte-supported MT-HF-SOFCs to form Ni-CGO anodes. LSCF-CGO cathodes were deposited on the outer surface of both these MT-HF-SOFCs before their electrochemical performances were compared at similar operating conditions. The performance of the anode-supported MT-HF-SOFCs which delivered ca. 480mWcm(-2) at 600 degrees C was superior to the electrolyte-supported MT-HF-SOFCs which delivered ca. six times lower power. The contribution of ohmic and electrode polarization losses of both FCs was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electrolyte-supported MT-HF-SOFCs had significantly higher ohmic and electrode polarization ASR values; this has been attributed to the thicker electrolyte and the difficulties associated with forming quality anodes inside the small (<1mm) lumen of the electrolyte tubes. Further development on co-extruded anode-supported MT-HF-SOFCs led to the fabrication of a thinner electrolyte layer and improved electrode microstructures which delivered a world leading 2,400mWcm(-2). The newly made cell was investigated at different H-2 flow rates and the effect of fuel utilization on current densities was analyzed.","[Droushiotis, N.; Kanawka, K.; Doraswami, U.; Li, K.; Kelsall, G.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Chem Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Dal Grande, F.; Metcalfe, I.

The catalyst, Pt black-graphene oxide (Pt-GO), was prepared by deposition of Pt black on the surface of graphene oxide nanosheet and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and voltammetry. The Pt-graphene (Pt-GR) composite modified glassy carbon electrode (Pt-GR/GCE) was prepared with cyclic voltammetric scanning of Pt-GO/GCE in the potential range from -1.5 to 0.2 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution at 50 mV center dot s(-1) for 5 cycles. The electrocatalytic properties of the Pt-GR/GCE for methanol (CH3OH) oxidation have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV); high electrocatalytic activity of the Pt-GR/GCE can be observed. This may be attributed to the high dispersion of Pt catalyst and the particular properties of GR support. The long-term stability of Pt-GR composite was investigated in 0.05 M CH3OH in 0.1 M H2SO4 solution. It can be observed that the peak current decreases gradually with the successive scans. The loss may result from the consumption of methanol during the CV scan. It also may be due to the poisoning organic compounds. The results imply that the Pt-GR composite has good potential applications in fuel cells.","[Chekin, Fereshteh] Islamic Azad Univ, Ayatollah Amoli Branch, Dept Chem, Amol, Iran; [Bagheri, Samira; Abd Hamid, Sharifah Bee] Univ Malaya, Nanotechnol & Catalysis Res Ctr NANOCAT, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia","Chekin, F (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Ayatollah Amoli Branch, Dept Chem, Amol, Iran.",fchekin@yahoo.com,"bagheri, samira/J-6236-2015; ABD HAMID, SHARIFAH BEE/B-9749-2010","bagheri, samira/0000-0003-1130-2656; ABD HAMID, SHARIFAH BEE/0000-0002-5104-3938",,,,38,13,13,0,85,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1432-8488,1433-0768,,J SOLID STATE ELECTR,J.

In this regard, water back-diffusion from cathode to anode is an important process as water is a reactant in the anode reactions. Beside the low cell efficiency, lack of water at the anode leads to form toxic intermediates which environmentally constrain the commercial applications. This study investigates exploiting hydrophobic cathode air filter as simple and effective strategy to enhance water back-diffusion. Typically, a passive vapor-feed DMFC using a porous carbon plate (PCP) on the anode surface was operated with different methanol concentrations up to 100% with and without the use of a hydrophobic cathode air filter. In situ mass spectrometry using a capillary probe was conducted for the anode gas layer to investigate the effect of the addition of the filter on the formation of reaction products at the anode surface. In normal DMFC, analysis of anode gas-layer indicated that formation methylformate (HCOOCH3) significantly increases upon utilizing high methanol concentrations. However, addition of the cathode air filter led to distinct decrease of the methanol crossover and increase of the water back-diffusion from the cathode to the anode especially at high methanol concentrations. The in situ gas analysis of the cell operated at 100 wt% (24.7 M) methanol revealed that the addition of the cathode filter significantly decreased the formation of the undesirable intermediates; 65% reduction in the amount of formed methylforrnate was observed. This effect was related to the increase in the ratio between the methanol and water vapor pressure (P-CH3OH/P-H2O) after addition of the filter and hence increased the performance of the passive DMFC when highly concentrated methanol was used as a fuel.

Among the renewable energy technologies, the solar energy coupling with fuel cell technology will be the promising possibilities for the future green energy solutions. Fuel cell cogeneration is an auspicious technology that can potentially reduce the energy consumption and environmental impact associated with serving building electrical and thermal demands. In this study, performance assessment of a co-generation system is presented to deliver electrical and thermal energy using the solar energy and the reversible solid oxide fuel cell. A mathematical model of the co-generation system is developed. To illustrate the performance, the system is considered in three operation modes: a solar-solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mode, which is low solar radiation time when the solar photovoltaic (PV) and SOFC are used for electric and heat load supply; a solar-solid oxide steam electrolyzer (SOSE) mode, which is high solar radiation time when PV is used for power supply to the electrical load and to the steam electrolyzer to generate hydrogen (H-2); and a SOFC mode, which is the power and heat generation mode of reversible SOFC using the storage H-2 at night time. Also the effects of solar radiation on the system performances and the effects of temperature on RSOFC are analyzed. In this study, 100 kW electric loads are considered and analyzed for the power and heat generation in those three modes to evaluate the performances of the system. This study is also revealed the combined heat and power (CHP) efficiency of the system. The overall system efficiency achieved for the solar-SOFC mode is 23%, for the solar-SOSE mode is 20% and for the SOFC mode is 83.6%. Besides, the Only electricity generation efficiency for the solar-SOFC mode is 15%, for the solar-SOSE mode is 14% and for the SOFC mode is 44.28%. An economic analysis is presented based on the annual electricity generation from the system and the system has shown the good economic viability in this study with a unit cost of energy (COB) about 0.068 $/kW h.

The TEM analysis showed that BSCF powders had uniform nanoparticle sizes and high homogeneity. The cross-sectional SEM micrograph of BSCF exhibited a continuous and no delaminated layer from the electrolyte-supported cell. The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of BSCF was 16.2 x 10(-6) K-1 at a temperature range of 600 degrees C to 800 degrees C.

Methods to produce a greener, cost effective and reliable source of alternative energy needs to be explored and exploited. One of those methods is done by integrating (or hybridizing) multiple different alternative energy sources (e.g. wind turbine generators, photovoltaic cell panels and fuel-fired generators, equipped with storage batteries) to form a distributed generation (DG) power system. However, even with DG power systems, cost effectiveness, reliability and pollutant emissions are still major issues that need to be resolved. The model development and optimization of the DG power system was carried out successfully in the previous work using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The goal was to minimize cost, maximize reliability and minimize emissions (multi-objective) subject to the requirements of the power balance and design constraints. In this work, due to the uncertain nature on the weather conditions, the power output from the PV cells, WTG and the storage batteries which are subject to insolation and wind conditions were fuzzified in an effort to create a more realistic model. The optimization (in a fuzzy environment) was then performed by using Hopfield neural network (HNN). The optimized results were then discussed and analyzed.","[Ganesan, T.] Univ Teknol Petronas, Dept Chem Engn, Perak 31750, Malaysia; [Elamvazuthi, I.] Univ Teknol Petronas, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Perak 31750, Malaysia; [Vasant, P.] Univ Teknol Petronas, Dept Fundamental & Appl Sci, Perak 31750, Malaysia","Vasant, P (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Petronas, Dept Fundamental & Appl Sci, Perak 31750, Malaysia.",pvasant@gmail.com,"Elamvazuthi, Irraivan/J-2508-2013; Vasant, Pandian/E-6501-2013; Elamvazuthi, Irraivan/S-1436-2019","Elamvazuthi, Irraivan/0000-0002-4721-9400; Elamvazuthi, Irraivan/0000-0002-4721-9400; Vasant, Pandian/0000-0002-0755-1046","STIRF grant of University Technology Petronas, Malaysia [90/10.11]","This work was supported by STIRF grant (STIRF CODE NO: 90/10.11) of University Technology Petronas, Malaysia.

The inverter system is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. It consists of a lead acid battery, third-order Butterworth low-pass DC filter and AC filter, H-bridge inverter, step-up transformer, and a variety of loads, as well as its sinusoidal pulse-width modulation (SPWM) deadbeat-based PI controller. In this paper, 2 simulation case studies are carried out, which are the abrupt load changes from a 400 W resistive load to a 500 W resistive load, and from a 400 W resistive load to an inductive load of 500 W 0.85 power factor lagging. From the simulation results for both cases, the state-of-charge of the battery decreases due to supplying power to the loads, yet the battery voltage remains constant at about 36 V and the battery current exhibits a smooth ripple despite the current spikes produced by the H-bridge inverter, which will prolong the lifespan of the battery. This shows that the DC filter performs satisfactorily to isolate the current spikes generated by the SPWM controller and H-bridge inverter. Moreover, even though the load varies for both cases, the sinusoidal inverter output voltage can be tracked and maintained at 230 V-rms with a 50 Hz frequency within a few cycles from the instant that the load is changed, as well as a low total harmonic distortion voltage (THDv) content of 1.53% and 2.78%, respectively. This indicates that the controller proves its robustness and stiffness characteristics in maintaining the output load voltage at the desired value to supply the power for a variety of loads with a minimum THDv.","[Tiang, Tow Leong; Ishak, Dahaman] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia","Tiang, TL (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Engn Campus, Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia.",tl.tiang.ee@gmail.com,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia through PRGS grant,The authors of this paper would like to express their appreciation and sincere gratitude to Universiti Sains Malaysia for providing funding for this project through a PRGS grant.,,31,16,16,0,9,TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY,ANKARA,"ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY",1300-0632,1303-6203,,TURK J ELECTR ENG CO,Turk.

The carbon-based porous layer was coated onto a carbon cloth with PTFE pre-treatment for delivering hydrophobic properties and applied in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Characterisation of electrochemical properties for three different anode electrodes was performed with cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at room temperature in a half-cell configuration. The evolution of the surface morphology of diffusion layer and electrodes was characterised by using variable-pressure scanning electron microscopy (VP-SEM). The electrochemical results indicate that electrode with CNF layer showed the highest current densities compared to CB and CB + CNF with the same catalyst loading. VP-SEM measurements show the network formation within the structure, which could facilitate the methanol mass transfer and improve the catalyst efficiency. The electrodes were applied to a single-cell DMFC, and the cell performance was experimentally investigated under passive operating mode and room temperature. A maximum power density of 23.0 mW cm(-2) at a current density of 88.0 mA cm(-2) with a 3 M dilute methanol solution was achieved. The results show that the electrodes with a CNF layer could improve the performance of DMFC as compared with commercially used CB and prove it's potentially application in DMFC technology especially for portable power source applications due to several advantages as followings: operating at low concentration of methanol, operating at room temperature, low catalyst loading in anode and cathode, cheaper, less hazardous and no parasitic load.

The results showed that Pani/V2O5 produced a power density of 79.26 mW/m(2), which is higher than V2O5 by 65.31 mW/m(2) and Pani by 42.4 mW/m(2). Furthermore, the Coulombic Efficiency of the system using Pani/V2O5 (16%) was higher than V2O5 and Pani by 9.2 and 5.5%, respectively. Pani-V2O5 also produced approximately 10% more power than Pt, the best and most common cathode catalyst. It declares that Pani-V2O5 can be a suitable alternative for application in a MFC system.

MGT-CGS consists of an MGT and an exhaust heat exchanger (EHE), whereas MGT-TGS consists of an MGT, an EHE, an absorption heat pump and a heat storage. Heat storage was essential for storing heat generated during daytime to be utilized during night-time in which heat demand was higher. MGT-TGS was a better configuration compared to MGT-CGS because it can utilize more exhaust heat and had Energy Recovery Utilized Efficiency (eta(ER,utilized)) of 0.37 and 0.80 during daytime and night-time, respectively. Furthermore, the payback period for the MGT-TGS was also shorter than MGT-CGS, 13.8 years under highly subsidized electricity tariff. The MGT-TGS also had a higher Fuel Energy Saving Index FESI when compared to a gas turbine, but had a lower FESI when compared to a combined cycle gas turbine.

In the present work, a mathematical model based on first principles is presented to avert such temperature fluctuations. The fuel cell running on ammonia is divided into five subsystems and factors such as mass/energy/momentum transfer, diffusion through porous media, electrochemical reactions, and polarization losses inside the subsystems are presented. Dynamic cell-tube temperature responses of the cell to step changes in conditions of the feed streams is investigated. The results of simulation indicate that the transient response of the SOFC is mainly influenced by the temperature dynamics. It is also shown that the inlet stream temperatures are associated with the highest long term start-up time (467 s) among other parameters in terms of step changes. In contrast the step change in fuel velocity has the lowest influence on the start-up time (about 190 s from initial steady state to the new steady state) among other parameters. A NNPC (neural network predictive controller) is then implemented for thermal stress management by controlling the cell tube temperature to avoid performance degradation by manipulating the temperature of the inlet air stream. The regulatory performance of the NNPC is compared with a PI (proportional-integral) controller. The performance of the control system confirms that NNPC is a non-linear-model-based strategy which can assure less oscillating control responses with shorter settling times in comparison to the PI controller.

The stability in water; in terms of dimensional change and dissolution, of the modified membrane was investigated and compared to the parent SPEEK membrane. SPEEK/Cloisite 15A (R)/TAP nanocomposite membrane exhibited the highest selectivity by means of the ratio of proton conductivity to methanol permeability. Owing to its higher proton conductivity and significantly lower methanol permeabilities and high stability in water environment, SPEEK/Cloisite 15A (R)/TAP nanocomposite membrane was found to be a potential alternative polymer electrolyte membrane for DMFC applications.","[Jaafar, Juhana; Ismail, A.

Generated power and current were analyzed through polarization and voltage curves. Parallel connections of three units, which fed with 10 g l(-1) of each substrate, resulted in voltage and power densities of 0.65 V and 72.77 mW m(-2), respectively. This configuration produced current density of 191.36 mA m(-2) which was approximately three times higher than a single unit.

The limiting crossover current density was measured to determine the methanol permeation in the DMFC. The effects of membrane annealing temperature and casting solvent of composite membrane on the cell performance were investigated and are discussed here. Compared to recast Nafion with the same thickness (150 mu m), the Pd-SiO(2)fibre/Nafion composite membrane exhibited higher performance and lower methanol permeability. A maximum power density of 10.4 mW cm(-2) was obtained with a 2 M methanol feed, outperforming the much thicker commercial Nafion 117 with a power density of 7.95 mW cm(-2) under the same operating conditions.

The membranes were prepared through sulfonation of PEEK, followed by the formation of polymer composite dope by using solution intercalation and membrane casting. The composite membrane properties were evaluated using H NMR, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), AC impedance spectroscopy and methanol diffusion test cell. The methanol permeability increased with the rise in temperature and reached a value of 0.52 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1) at 60 degrees C; which coincided with proton conductivity of 47.10 mS cm(-1) and a methanol selectivity of 9.1 x 10(4) S s cm(-3). The methanol permeability was found to be lower than that of Nafion (R) 117 membrane at all investigated temperatures. The nanocomposite SPEEK membranes were tested in a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), and the membrane denoted as SPEEK/CC2.5/TAP5.0 achieved a power density of 54.93 mW cm(-2) at 60 degrees C. The results of this study suggest that SPEEK/CC2.5/TAP5.0 nanocomposite membrane has a potential to be an alternative polymer electrolyte for DMFC application. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Pre-treatment has shown significant improvement in MFC electricity productivity especially from microwave treated sludge. Higher COD reduction in the MFC has been revealed from microwave treated sludge with 55% for total and 85% for soluble COD, respectively. Nonetheless, longer ozonation treatment did not give additional advantage compared to the raw sludge. On the other hand, samples from anodes were analyzed using the 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing technique for microbial community analysis. There was substantial difference in community compositions among MFCs fed with different pretreated sludge. Bacteroidetes was the abundant bacterial phylum dominated in anodes of higher productivity MFCs. These results demonstrate that using waste sludge as the substrate in MFCs could achieve both sludge reduction and electricity generation, and proper pre-treatment of sludge could improve the overall process performance.

This assessment focuses on power quality (PQ) and compatibility between REGs and existing system components. Electric vehicle (EV) technology has also recently achieved a substantial market share. This technology requires the development of charging stations similar to current petroleum fuelling stations in the near future. Thus, the effect of EV stations (EVSs) on PQ must also be considered. This study presents a PQ analysis on the effects of high-penetration EVS and REG systems, including wind turbines, grid-connected photovoltaics (PVs), and fuel cell (FC) power generation units on a modified 16-bus distribution system under different loading and weather conditions. All data on EVS, wind farm, PV, and FC units as well as weather conditions presented in this paper were collected from different power companies and the Malaysian Meteorological Department. The system is modelled and simulated using the MATLAB/Simulink software to study the effects of these technologies on system performances at various penetration levels. Simulation results indicated that the presence of high-penetration EVSs and REGs can cause severe PQ problems such as frequency and voltage fluctuations, voltage drop, harmonic distortion and power factor reduction.

The major concern of this technique is the high operational cost that is caused by Nafion 117 used as a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) and Pt as a cathode catalyst for oxygen reduction. Sulfonated poly ether ether ketone (SPEEK) was used as a PEM in MFC for this study. The results indicate that even though the power production of MFC with SPEEK (773 mW.m(-2)) was lower than Nafion 117 (106.7 mW.m(-2)), it is more cost effective, due to its lower price. Our cost evaluation suggests that the use of SPEEK in power production is about two times more cost effective than that of Nafion 117. Furthermore, its chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal (88%) is higher than Nafion 117 (76%); and thus, SPEEK, given substantial increases in power density may be a promising PEM in MFCs at an industrial scale.

Ethanol production via consolidated bioprocessing requires a suitable microorganism to withstand the harsh fermentation environment of high temperature, high ethanol concentration, and exposure to inhibitors. We genetically enhanced an industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, sun049, enabling it to uptake xylose as the sole carbon source at high fermentation temperature. This strain was able to produce 13.9 g/l ethanol from 50 g/l xylose at 38 A degrees C. To better understand the xylose consumption ability during long-term, high-temperature conditions, we compared by transcriptomics two fermentation conditions: high temperature (38 A degrees C) and control temperature (30 A degrees C) during the first 12 h of fermentation. This is the first long-term, time-based transcriptomics approach, and it allowed us to discover the role of heat-responsive genes when xylose is the sole carbon source. The results suggest that genes related to amino acid, cell wall, and ribosomal protein synthesis are down-regulated under heat stress. To allow cell stability and continuous xylose uptake in order to produce ethanol, hexose transporter HXT5, heat shock proteins, ubiquitin proteins, and proteolysis were all induced at high temperature. We also speculate that the strong relationship between high temperature and increased xylitol accumulation represents the cell's mechanism to protect itself from heat degradation.","[Ismail, Ku Syahidah Ku; Sakamoto, Takatoshi; Kondo, Akihiko] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Chem Sci & Engn, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Ismail, Ku Syahidah Ku] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Bioproc Engn, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia; [Hasunuma, Tomohisa] Org Adv Sci & Technol, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan","Kondo, A (corresponding author), Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Chem Sci & Engn, Nada Ku, 1-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",akondo@kobe-u.ac.jp,"Hasunuma, Tomohisa/A-1949-2015; Kondo, Akihiko/A-2130-2015; Ismail, Ku Syahidah Ku/AAA-2532-2019","Hasunuma, Tomohisa/0000-0002-8382-2362; ","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) [P07015]; Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) of Japan; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Technology (MEXT) of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology, Creation of Innovative Centers for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research Areas (Innovative Bioproduction Kobe), MEXT, Japan; Ministry of Higher Education of MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia; University Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP), Malaysia","This work was supported through project P07015 by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) under the sponsorship of the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) of Japan.

Their suitability as cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) was investigated. The BSCF solutions was heated to 100 degrees C yielding a metal-citrate-nitrate gel complex precursor which was later calcined at 1000 degrees C for a period of 4 hours to produce the BSCF powder. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the calcined powder showed that it had undergone a complete phase formation. It was found that the pH value was crucial for the chelation process as well as for the purity of the phase obtained. The BSCF with a compact particle arrangement was obtained at pH 9. The nitrogen adsorption studies indicated that the BSCF powders had a mixture of microporous and mesoporous particles. Analysis by thermogravimetry revealed that the weight loss resulted from the oxygen-releasing capacity of the BSCF structure. The largest surface area was observed for BSCF powders prepared at pH 9. The BSCF at pH 9 prepared at various solution volumes was deposited on a glassy carbon electrode and characterized electrochemically. Cyclic voltammograms showed that the amount of BSCF deposited influenced the electron transfer, mass transport and capacitance behavior.

The composite membranes are made by immersing Nafion-112 membranes in a solution containing aniline for different immersion times. The presence of polyaniline and sulfonic functional groups in the composite membranes is confirmed by means of Fourier transform infrared analysis while their surface roughness is determined by using atomic force microscopy prior to microbial fuel cell operation. Biofouling on the membranes' surface is also examined by using a scanning electron microscope after microbial fuel cell operation. The polarization curves and, hence, the power density curves are measured by varying the load's resistance. The power density of the microbial fuel cell with the Nafion/polyaniline composite membranes improves significantly as the amount of polyaniline increases because the interaction between sulfonic groups in the Nafion matrix and polyaniline in the polyaniline domains increases proton conductivity. However, it declines after more polyaniline is added because of less conjugated bonding of polyaniline and sulfonic acid groups for larger polyaniline domains in the Nafion matrix. The voltage overpotential is also smaller as the amount of polyaniline increases. Biofouling also decreases with increasing polyaniline in the Nafion/polyaniline composite membranes because they have smoother surfaces than Nafion membranes. The results show that the maximum power generated by the microbial fuel cells with Nafion112-polyaniline composite membrane is 124.03mV m(-2) with a current density of 454.66 mA m(-2), which is approximately more than ninefold higher than that of microbial fuel cells with neat Nafion-112. It can be concluded that the power density of the microbial fuel cell can be increased by modifying the Nafion membrane separators with more conductive polymers that are less susceptible to biofouling to improve its proton conductivity.","[Mokhtarian, Nader; Ghasemi, Mostafa; Daud, Wan Ramli Wan; Ismail, Manal] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Chem & Proc Engn, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Ukm Bangi, Malaysia; [Najafpour, Ghasem] Babol Noshirvani Univ Technol, Fac Chem Engn, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Babol Sar, Iran; [Alam, Javed] King Saud Univ, King Abdullah Inst Nanotechnol, Alriyadh 2455, Saudi Arabia","Daud, WRW (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Chem & Proc Engn, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Ukm Bangi, Malaysia.",wramli@gmail.com,"ISMAIL, MANAL/M-1983-2016; Daud, Wan Ramli/B-3635-2013; Alam, Javed/E-9639-2013","Daud, Wan Ramli/0000-0002-1023-456X; Alam, Javed/0000-0003-4913-4870; Ghasemi, Mostafa/0000-0002-1497-1591",Fuel Cell Institute of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM),The authors would like to acknowledge the financial and scientific support of the Fuel Cell Institute of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM).

Based on the requirements established by the US Department of Energy (DOE), the in-plane electrical conductivity and flexural strength are required to be greater than 100 S/cm and 25 MPa, respectively. The high filler loading is needed to satisfy the high in-plane electrical conductivity. However, the high filler loading reduces the flexural strength and manufacturability of the composite. In this study, the composites were prepared by compounding using an internal mixer followed by compression moulding. The combination of 10 vol% carbon black (CB) as the second filler with synthetic graphite/epoxy (SG/EP) resulted in the following composite properties: 150 S/cm (in-plane conductivity), 55 S/cm (through-plane conductivity), and 38.8 MPa (flexural strength). Used as the second filler, the CB, which had a small-sized diameter, formed conductive networks that filled the voids between the SG and polymer matrix. The in-plane electrical conductivity and flexural strength of the CB/SG/EP composites at the optimum composition exceeded the requirement for bipolar plate applications.

The water content depended on the relative humidity profile along the gas channel. In this investigation, a negative value for the water back-diffusion flux was measured; thus, the transport of water from the cathode to the anode did not occur.

With the aim of solving this problem without adverse effects on the membrane conductivity, Nafion/Palladium-silica nanofiber (N/Pd-SiO2) composite membranes with various fiber loadings were prepared by a solution casting method. The silica-supported palladium nanofibers had diameters ranging from 100 nm to 200 nm and were synthesized by a facile electro-spinning method. The thermal properties, ionic exchange capacities, water uptake, proton conductivities, methanol permeabilities, chemical structures, and micro-structural morphologies were determined for the prepared membranes. It was found that the transport properties of the membranes were affected by the fiber loading. All of the composite membranes showed higher water uptake and ion exchange capacities compared to commercial Nafion 117 and proved to be thermally stable for use as proton exchange membranes. The composite membranes with optimum fiber content (3 wt%) showed an improved proton conductivity of 0.1292 S cm(-1) and a reduced methanol permeability of 8.36 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1). In single cell tests, it was observed that, the maximum power density measured with composite membrane is higher than those of commercial Nafion 117.

Commercially available powders of NiO and scandia stabilized zirconia were used, with average particle sizes of 0.714 and 2.151 mu m, respectively. The thixotropy and viscosity of inks increased with increasing solid content. The particle network strength, important to the production of films with good particle connectivity and mechanical strength, also increased as the solids content increased. The complex modulus, G*, (indicative of the overall elasticity and tackiness of the inks) ranged from 500 to 4000 Pa, a range found acceptable for screen-printing. The minimum and maximum acceptable solids content were determined to be 25 and 30 vol% respectively. Inks having solids content outside this range were too liquid like and tacky, respectively, for effective screen-printing. The percentage of ink recovery, indicative of the print quality of the resultant films, also increased with solid content. The relevant properties of the anode films, including mechanical strength, electronic conductivity and electrochemical performance, all improved with increasing solids content as a result of improved particle connectivity, consistent with the conclusions drawn from the rheological study. In summary, from the perspective of ink rheology, screen-printability and performance, inks having 28-30 vol% solids were determined as the most suitable for the production of high quality SOFC anode films with a thickness of around 10 mu m.

This review paper discusses commonly used Cu-based catalysts including their kinetic, compositional, and morphological characteristics in methanol reforming reactions. Although research exploring surface reaction mechanism over various Cu-based catalysts was first attempted about three decades ago, the scheme remains controversial. This technical discussion will focus on the commonly reported surface intermediate species, which are methoxy, formaldehyde, dioxymethylene, formate and methyl formate. The surface reaction mechanism could be complicated by the introduction of reactants such as oxygen and steam, into the system as they would subsequently initiate secondary reactions.

Options to produce greener, cost effective, and reliable source of alternative energy need to be explored and exploited. One of the major advances in the development of this sort of power source was done by integrating (or hybridizing) multiple different alternative energy sources (e.g., wind turbine generators, photovoltaic cell panels, and fuel-fired generators, equipped with storage batteries) to form a distributed generation (DG) power system. However, even with DG power systems, cost effectiveness, reliability, and pollutant emissions are still major issues that need to be resolved. The model development and optimization of the DG power system were carried out successfully in the previous work using particle swarm optimization (PSO). The goal was to minimize cost, maximize reliability, and minimize emissions (multi-objective function) subject to the requirements of the power balance and design constraints. In this work, the optimization was performed further using Hopfield neural networks (HNN), PSO, and HNN-PSO techniques.

The SDCC electrolyte composite was prepared by mixing 80 wt% SDC with 20 wt% Li and Na carbonate (Li/Na ratio of 2/1) via a solid state reaction method. The resultant SDCC electrolyte composite powder was uniaxially pressed into a circular pellet and sintered at 500 degrees C, 550 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 650 degrees C for 5 h. A symmetrical cell was finally fabricated by painting a conductive silver paste on both sides of the dense SDCC electrolyte composite pellet, and its I-V performance was measured using hydrogen and air as the fuel and oxidant, respectively. The phase structure and microstructure of the composite powders were investigated using an X-ray diffractometer, field emission scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscope. Ceramic pellets sintered at 550 degrees C exhibited a maximum power density of 63.3 mW/cm(2) and an open circuit voltage of 1.14 V at an operating temperature of 650 degrees C.

An easy to implement, low CPU time-consuming reduced order steady state PAFC stack model, that maps the PAFC performance satisfactorily, is used as the equality constraint equation block and variable bounds are humidifier, and cell temperature on the stack power generation are simulated. Electrolyte concentration, inferentially predicted by the model aids to identify acid drying and dilution during operation. For optimization two variables namely load current and electrolyte (phosphoric acid) concentration are considered as the optimization variables; the optimized values of which are communicated as set points for gas flow rates and humidifier temperature at the advanced control level. In the present paper steady state optimization is carried out using the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm with quasi-Newton line searching to enhance convergence. Two case studies have been performed (i) economic optimization for a PAFC stack resulting in maximization of profit and (ii) optimization to achieve a time variant electrical load based on market demand. For very high demand power the optimizer converges to the maximum possible power and restricts the system from entering into a state of operational breakdown. The inferential reduced order model based optimization scheme showed promising potential for real-life utilization of fuel cells remote rural areas, marine, submarine, desert, mountain terrains, oceanographic applications, and transport systems, where large computational facilities are neither possible nor feasible.","[Ganguly, Saibal] Univ Teknol Petronas, Dept Chem Engn, Tronoh, Perak, Malaysia; [Das, Sonali; Kargupta, Kajari] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Kolkata, India; [Banerjee, Dipali] Bengal Engn & Sci Univ, Dept Phys, Sibpur, India","Ganguly, S (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Petronas, Dept Chem Engn, Tronoh, Perak, Malaysia.",gangulysaibal2011@gmail.com,"Banerjee, Dipali/AAB-7353-2019",,,,,12,2,2,0,15,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0888-5885,,,IND ENG CHEM RES,Ind.

In this study, sol gel made alumina supports prepared for nickel (Ni) catalysts were calcined at different temperatures. A series of (Ni/Al-S.G.) catalysts were synthesized by an impregnation procedure. The influence of varying the calcination temperature of the sol gel made supports on catalyst activity was tested in ethanol reforming reaction. The characteristics of the sol gel alumina supports and Ni catalysts were affected by the calcination temperature of the supports. The structure of the sol gel made alumina supports was transformed in the order of gamma -> (gamma + theta) -> theta-alumina as the calcination temperature of the supports increased from 600 degrees C to 1000 degrees C. Both hydrogen yield and ethanol conversion presented a volcano-shaped behavior with maximum values of 4.3 mol/mol ethanol fed and 99.5%, respectively. The optimum values were exhibited over Ni/Al-S.G800 (Ni catalyst supported on sol gel made alumina calcined at 800 degrees C). The high performance of the Ni/Al-S.G800 catalyst may be attributed to the strong interaction of Ni species and sol gel made alumina which lead to high nickel dispersion and small particle size.","[Yaakob, Zahira; Bshish, Ahmed; Ebshish, Ali; Tasirin, Siti Masrinda] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Chem & Proc Engn, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Alhasan, Fatah H.] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Sci, Catalysis Sci & Technol Res Ctr, Upm Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia","Yaakob, Z (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Chem & Proc Engn, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",zahira65@yahoo.com; ahmedbshish@gmail.com; aliebshish@gmail.com; masrinda@eng.ukm.my; abuomohd999@yahoo.com,,"Alhassan, FatahH/0000-0002-2749-0658; Yaakob, Zahira/0000-0002-8259-1785","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia [03-01-02-SF0696, ERGS/1/2011/TK/UKM/03/19]",The authors gratefully thank the university authority for financial support provided for this work by the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia under the grants number of 03-01-02-SF0696 and ERGS/1/2011/TK/UKM/03/19.,,26,20,20,0,37,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1996-1944,,,MATERIALS,Materials,JUN,2013,6,6,,,,,2229,2239,,10.3390/ma6062229,,,11,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Materials Science,169IA,WOS:000320772300007,28809270,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,1/2/2021,

From the rheological tests, terpineol and texanol inks with 1-3 wt% binder were suitable for screen-printing at the applied screen-printing condition, and hence these inks were used to study their rheological impact on the properties of resultant films. The mechanical hardness of anode films increased with binder content. Moreover, the electronic conductivity and electrode polarization resistance of the reduced films increased and decreased, respectively, with increasing binder content. The improved film properties can be related to the increased particle network strength within the inks, leading to improved film microstructures for application as SOFC anodes. The study also confirmed that the properties of films were more significantly affected by the binder content than solvent type, which had only a minor effect. Overall, from the perspective of ink rheology, screen-printability and performance, an ink with 3 wt% binder gave the best performance at the applied screen-printing condition.

In its raw form, POME is highly polluting due to its high content of biological and chemical oxygen demand. In the present paper, POME was treated using double chamber microbial fuel cell with simultaneous generation of electricity. Polyacrylonitrile carbon felt (PACF), a new electrode material was used as electrode throughout the MFC experiments. Various dilutions of raw POME were used to analyze the effect of initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) on MFC power generation, COD removal efficiency and coulombic efficiency. Anaerobic sludge was used as inoculum for all the MFC experiments. Since this inoculum originated from POME, it showed higher potential to generate bioenergy from complex POME. Anaerobic sludge enhanced the power production due to better utilization of substrates by various types of microorganisms present in it. Among the raw POME and different concentrations of POME used, the PACF with raw POME showed the maximum power density and volumetric power density of about 45 mW/m(2) and 304 mW/m(3), respectively, but it showed low coulombic efficiency and low COD removal efficiency of about 0.8 % and 45 %, respectively. The MFC PACF with 1: 50 dilution showed higher COD removal efficiency and coulombic efficiency of about 70 % and 24 % but showed low power density and low volumetric power density of about 22 mW/m(2) and 149 mW/m(3), respectively. The formation of biofilm onto the electrode surface has been confirmed from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) experiments. The results confirm that MFC possesses great potential for the simultaneous treatment of POME and power generation using PACF as electrode and also shows that initial COD has great influence on coulombic efficiency, COD removal efficiency and power generation.","[Baranitharan, E.; Khan, Maksudur R.; Prasad, D.

To develop the capacity of the PEMFC system, anhydrous membranes containing imidazole groups have garnered much interest. In this research, the relationship between the hydrogen bond networks, including the consequent packing structure, and the proton conductivity of water and imidazole (Im) systems have been systematically studied. The effect of external electrostatic perturbation was investigated in (H2O)H+center dot center dot center dot H2O, (Im)H+center dot center dot center dot Im, bulk water, and imidazole superlattice systems. In all of these cases, the application of an electric field in a direction opposite to that of the overall system dipole significantly reduces the activation barrier for proton transport. In isolated systems, (H2O)H+center dot center dot center dot H(2)0O and (Im)H+center dot center dot center dot Im, the preferred orientation angle between the neighbouring molecules was 90. From density functional molecular dynamics simulations of the bulk system, the proton diffusion coefficient was found to increase under the perturbation by the applied electric fields in range of 1.29 x 10(7) to 3.86 x 10(7) V cm(-1) (0.0025-0.0075 a.u.) for both water and imidazole.

Solar-driven H-2 production from H2O theoretically provides the highest-efficiency route to fuel production in microalgae. This is because the H-2-producing hydrogenase (HYDA) is directly coupled to the photosynthetic electron transport chain, thereby eliminating downstream energetic losses associated with the synthesis of carbohydrate and oils (feedstocks for methane, ethanol and oil-based fuels). Here we report the simultaneous knock-down of three light-harvesting complex proteins (LHCMB1, 2 and 3) in the high H-2-producing Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant Stm6Glc4 using an RNAi triple knock-down strategy. The resultant Stm6Glc4L01 mutant exhibited a light green phenotype, reduced expression of LHCBM1 (20.6% +/- 0.27%), LHCBM2 (81.2% +/- 0.037%) and LHCBM3 (41.4% +/- 0.05%) compared to 100% control levels, and improved light to H-2 (180%) and biomass (165%) conversion efficiencies. The improved H-2 production efficiency was achieved at increased solar flux densities (450 instead of similar to 100 mu E m(-2) s(-1)) and high cell densities which are best suited for microalgae production as light is ideally the limiting factor. Our data suggests that the overall improved photon-to-H-2 conversion efficiency is due to: 1) reduced loss of absorbed energy by non-photochemical quenching (fluorescence and heat losses) near the photobioreactor surface; 2) improved light distribution in the reactor; 3) reduced photoinhibition; 4) early onset of HYDA expression and 5) reduction of O-2-induced inhibition of HYDA. The Stm6Glc4L01 phenotype therefore provides important insights for the development of high-efficiency photobiological H-2 production systems.","[Oey, Melanie; Ross, Ian L.; Stephens, Evan; Wolf, Juliane; Radzun, Khairul Adzfa; Ringsmuth, Andrew K.; Hankamer, Ben] Univ Queensland, Inst Mol Biosci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Steinbeck, Janina] Univ Munster, Inst Plant Biol & Biotechnol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Kruse, Olaf] Univ Bielefeld, Ctr Biotechnol CeBiTec, Dept Algae Biotechnol & Bioenergy, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Kuegler, Johannes] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Proc Engn Life Sci, Sect Tech Biol 2, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Ringsmuth, Andrew K.] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Engn Quantum Syst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Radzun, Khairul Adzfa] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Sci Appl, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia","Hankamer, B (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Inst Mol Biosci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",b.hankamer@imb.uq.edu.au,"Oey, Melanie/H-3873-2016; Wolf, Juliane/V-9228-2019; Wolf, Juliane/B-7921-2016; Oey, Melanie/N-9517-2019; Ross, Ian/A-8622-2011; Stephens, Evan/K-1690-2014; Hankamer, Ben D/C-9688-2015","Oey, Melanie/0000-0001-9290-0580; Wolf, Juliane/0000-0002-7825-3118; Wolf, Juliane/0000-0002-7825-3118; Oey, Melanie/0000-0001-9290-0580; Ross, Ian/0000-0002-2389-4292; Stephens, Evan/0000-0001-8390-7246; Hankamer, Ben D/0000-0001-9284-4929; Ringsmuth, Andrew/0000-0002-2984-8860; Kruse, Olaf/0000-0001-9874-382X",Pacific Seeds; Advanta India; Pacific Seeds and Advanta India Limited;  [LP0883380];  [BH011372],"This project was supported by Grants LP0883380 and BH011372 and had financial support from Pacific Seeds (http://www.pacificseeds.com.au) and Advanta India (http://www.advantaindia.com).

This paper discusses the effect of the presence of various nanoparticles on the morphology and efficiency of the polymeric membranes in the separation of liquid phase. The presence of nanoparticles usually increases the hydrophilicity and decreases the fouling of polymeric membranes during the filtration process. The presence of TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, Fe3O4, Ag, and Fe nanoparticles increases the mechanical and thermal resistant of the polymeric membranes. The TiO2 and Ag result in anti-bacterial characteristics, ZrO2 and Fe create catalytic properties, SiO2 nanoparticle causes conductivity properties, and Fe3O4 nanoparticle gives magnetic characteristics to polymeric membranes. Understanding the synthesis method (in situ or ex situ) and the combination routes (blending with polymeric matrix or deposition on the surface) of the used nanoparticles is very important in determining the structure and performance of the composite membranes during liquid filtration. Findings from such studies are highlighted and the future possibility of nanocomposite membrane application in liquid filtration is also discussed.","[Homayoonfal, Maryam; Mehrnia, Mohammad Reza; Mojtahedi, Yasaman Mohades] Univ Tehran, Univ Coll Engn, Sch Chem Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Adv Membrane Technol Res Ctr AMTEC, Skudai 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia","Mehrnia, MR (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Univ Coll Engn, Sch Chem Engn, POB 11155-4563, Tehran, Iran.",mmehrnia@ut.ac.ir,"Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi/D-2643-2012","Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi/0000-0003-0150-625X; Homayoonfal, Maryam/0000-0001-8448-3609",,,,206,43,44,1,129,DESALINATION PUBL,HOPKINTON,"36 WALCOTT VALLEY DRIVE,, HOPKINTON, MA 01748 USA",1944-3994,1944-3986,,DESALIN WATER TREAT,Desalin.

Physical adsorption process was used to immobilise the BM on the TiO2 thin film. Crystalline structure and surface morphology of the thin films were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) techniques. N3 commercial dye was also used as a dopant to the TiO2 films for comparison. Light absorption spectra and bandgap energy of the thin films were determined using UV-vis spectroscopy. Light absorption of the TiO2 thin film doped with BM was better than the TiO2 doped with the N3 commercial dye. Band edges of the TiO2 thin film and the BM were determined via cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. Top-edge of the BM valence band (VB) was more positive than the bottom edge of the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 film (vs. NHE). PEC analysis indicated that photocurrent of TiO2 doped with the BM electrode was higher than TiO2 doped with the N3 in the beginning of illumination process, but the performance was defeated after a while. Based on the optical properties and the PEC analyses, BM has potential to be used as dye sensitisers for a PEC cell. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

A good DMFC electrolyte membrane should possess high proton conductivity and low methanol permeability. In this work, the fabricated SPEEK/cSMM membranes were compared with pure SPEEK and commercial Nafion 112 membranes in terms of water uptake, proton conductivity, and methanol permeability at temperature range of room to 80 degrees C The water uptake of SPEEK/cSMM membranes increased with the temperature and it was higher than that of SPEEK and Nafion 112 membranes; however newly fabricated membranes with 68% and 76% DS were dissolved at high temperatures although showed the same trend at lower temperatures. In agreement with the result of water uptake, proton conductivity of SPEEK/cSMM membranes also increased with temperature and was higher as compared to the corresponding SPEEK membranes; however it was still lower than that of Nafion 112. The methanol permeability values of the SPEEK/cSMM membranes were lower at different temperatures as compared to corresponding SPEEK and Nafion 112 at the same condition. Owing to considerable proton conductivity and lower methanol permeability values, SPEEK60/cSMM exhibited the highest overall performance than other tested membranes at 60 degrees C. These results indicated that SPEEK60/cSMM membrane is promising to be used as a polymer electrolyte membrane in direct methanol fuel cell. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The minimum requirements set by the US Department of Energy (DOE) are the electrical conductivity and flexural strength to be greater than 100 S/cm and 25 MPa, respectively. In this study, the electrical conductivity of a G/epoxy (EP) composite (single filler) is only 50 S/cm (in-plane conductivity) at 80 wt% G. However, flexural strength is greater than 25 MPa. Using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the second filler at a concentration of 5 wt% in a CNTs/G/EP nanocomposite resulted in the in-plane and through-plane electrical conductivity and flexural strength being 180 S/cm, 75 S/cm, and 45 MPa, respectively. The density of the CNTs/G/EP nanocomposite is also less than that of G/EP composite, which demonstrates that a total weight reduction is achievable. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

A combination of solar energy and wind energy as intermittent renewable energy sources with a fuel cell (FC) system and a battery storage energy system as a backup to the green energy system is introduced for this study. This system is eco-friendly, economical over the long-term, highly sustainable and reliable. In addition, a diesel-based energy system as a non-green system is compared with the proposed green system. National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) HOMER software is used to determine and compare the optimal configuration green energy system with the diesel-based energy system in terms of net present cost, sensitivity analysis and pollutant gas emission. The feasibility and assessment of the proposed system is evaluated by utilizing the load profile and considering the geographical condition of a village (Juara village in Tioman Island) with approximately 30 chalets located in southern Malaysia. HOMER uses two types of load profiles for each given year. The first load profile is used during the presence of tourists, and the second profile is used when the locals are the main inhabitants of the island. The optimization management for the green energy system is performed through unit sizing to find the optimum power management analysis and to perform cost analysis of the system. The potential of renewable energy as well as a diesel-based energy system to meet the power demand for such a stand-alone system is considered. Technically feasible and economically viable green energy systems as prospective plans are explored in this study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Ashourian, M. H.; Cherati, S.

Thermoelectric (TE) cells coupled with the PMB constituted the cogeneration system developed in this study. The TE cells attached to the hexagonal walls absorbed the heat of combustion. Experiment was carried out for two different equivalence ratio of 1.3 and 1.6 and the values of maximum flame temperature, CO and NOx emissions were measured. A mobile phone was connected to the TE charger system to demonstrate the ability of the cogeneration system to generate electric power. Results show that the PM (porous medium) burner can be used for heating and cell phone charging. The average surface temperature obtained in this study was 544.8 degrees C for a flow rate of 0.25 L/min which was similar to that obtained in the simulation. The total voltage output that could be developed by the TE cells was 9.3 V, which dropped to 7 V during charging. Moreover, the values of CO and COu emission decreased as fuel supply increased. In addition, very low NOx emissions were determined in this PMB set up highlighting the usefulness of PMB for domestic burner applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This work studies multilinear-model predictive control of a tubular SOFC. The objective is to control the fuel cell outlet voltage over a wide range of operating conditions by manipulating inlet fuel pressure (flow rate). A first-principles model of an ammonia fed-tubular solid oxide fuel cell is used for the controller design. The model accounts for diffusion, inherent impedance, transport (momentum, heat and mass transfer), electrochemical reactions, activation and concentration polarizations, and the ammonia decomposition reaction. The servo and regulatory performances of the multimodel predictive controller (MMPC) are compared with those of a single-model predictive controller (SMPC) and a proportional-integral (PI) controller. For small load changes, the MMPC, SMPC, and PI controller all provide zero offset, and the MMPC yields the best closed-loop performance. However, for large load changes, the SMPC and PI controller fail to provide zero offset; under these two controllers the closed-loop system with the large load changes is unstable.","[Hajimolana, Seyedahmad; Hussain, M.

The electrical conductivity and mechanical properties of these composites are determined and compared between the different functionalization processes. The results show that UV/O-3-treated functionalization is capable of introducing carboxylic functional groups on CNTs. Acid-treated CNT composites give low electrical conductivity, compared with UV/O-3-treated and As-produced CNTs. The in-and through-plane electrical conductivities and flexural strength of multifiller EP/G/MWCNTs (As-produced and UV/O-3-treated) achieved the US Department of Energy targets.

The effect of variables, namely, electric current (I) and hydraulic retention time (HRT), on the pH was considered in the nitrification chamber. The response surface methodology was used based on three levels to develop empirical models for the study on the effects of HRT and current values as independent operating variables on NH4+-N removal. The results showed that ammonium was reduced within the function of an extensive operational range of electric intensity (20-50 mA) and HRT (6-24 h).

This study investigates the thermal stability, by means of thermal expansion and oxidation behaviour, of the nanostructured FeCr alloy prepared by different consolidation techniques by means of the spark plasma sintering (SPS) method and to compare with conventional sintering technique by means of hot pressing (HP). This has potential application as interconnect in solid oxide fuel cell. Commercially available ferritic steel is chosen as a comparison of another high Cr ferritic model alloy. The beneficial effect of the reactive element by means of lanthanum onto the alloy surface that is introduced using ion implantation is also explored. The specific aspects studied were the effects of nanocrystalline structure, influenced by sintering method and surface treatment through La ion implantation of chromia forming alloys, which may improve their high thermal stability. Oxidation testing was conducted at 900-1100 degrees C for 100 h in laboratory air. Characterisations using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive Xray spectroscopy were carried out before and after each route or process to investigate the microstructure, phase change and formation of the oxide layer. The results revealed that the FeCr alloy prepared by SPS were more effective to retain nanocrystalline and better properties than those prepared by HP and the commercially available ferritic alloy. For all types of specimens, the presence of La had no detectable effect on thermal expansion but a major effect on scale adherence. The coefficients of thermal expansion for the alloy prepared by SPS were lower than those prepared by HP, and the scale adherence to the La implanted alloy was generally superior. The results consistently showed that a better reduction in oxidation resistance corresponds to excellent nanostructured alloy and La implantation.","[Khaerudini, D.

The model accounts for diffusion, inherent impedance, transport (heat and mass transfer), electrochemical reactions, activation and concentration polarizations of electrodes and the ammonia decomposition reaction. Sensitivity analyses are conducted upon the effects of design parameters on the fuel cell performance. Dynamic output voltage, fuel-cell-tube temperature and efficiency responses to step changes in the inlet fuel flow pressure with different values of design parameters are discussed. It is found that among the studied parameters, the inner cell tube diameter has the strongest effect on fuel cell efficiency. On the other hand, the influence of cathodic porosity on fuel cell performance and transient response is higher than that of the anodic porosity. The transient response with different sizes of micro and macro-structures is studied and it is observed that changing the fuel cell length has the most effect. Also NH3-SOFC is compared with H-2-SOFC and it is found that the performance of the former is close to that of the latter thus signifying that ammonia is a suitable fuel for substituting in place of hydrogen.

The main purpose of this study was to evaluate laboratory scale MFC which was inoculated with sludge containing mixed culture grown in palm oil mill effluent (POME). This work also aimed to construct a suitable design of MFC and to observe mixed culture activation that could lead to electric power production. POME was used in diluted form with COD concentration of 3750 mg-COD L-1. The performance of power generation and the efficiency of waste-water treatment in term of COD, nitrogen and total carbohydrate removal, in dual chamber MFC were recorded and analysed everyday for 15 days. The plots between experimental data and polarization model fit well and are able to describe the ability of power density generated in each day. Power density increased from 1.607 mW m(-2) (3.816 mA m(-2)), in the first day of the experiments to a maximum value on the third day 1.979 mW m(-2) (4.780 mA m(-2)) and then slowed down in day seventh to a minimum value of 1.311 mW m(-2) (3.346 mA m(-2)). The removal efficiency in MFC could be divided into three different levels. The first level is in term of poor efficiency although the power was increasing, while in the second level, the efficiency was getting higher and finally in third level, power production of MFC started to diminish. The highest efficiency occurs during the third level when steady power generation took place at certain level. The treatment efficiency in term of COD removal, nitrogen and carbohydrate utilization at day 15th were 54.9, 100 and 98.9%, respectively. The relationship between electricity power generation and treatment efficiency was successfully modelled into linear equation based on the respective power generation levels.","[Su, Lim Swee; Jahim, Jamalah Md; Shari, Siti Norhana; Ismail, Manal; Daud, Wan Ramli Wan] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Sel Fuel, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor DE, Malaysia","Su, LS (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Sel Fuel, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor DE, Malaysia.",limss@ukm.my,"ISMAIL, MANAL/M-1983-2016; Daud, Wan Ramli/B-3635-2013; Lim, Swee Su/C-9794-2013","Daud, Wan Ramli/0000-0002-1023-456X; Lim, Swee Su/0000-0001-6921-4515",,,,23,3,3,0,13,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,SELANGOR,"FACULTY SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, BANGI, SELANGOR, 43600, MALAYSIA",0126-6039,,,SAINS MALAYS,Sains Malays.,OCT,2012,41,10,,,,,1253,1261,,,,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036XI,WOS:000311065200012,,,,,1/2/2021,

Thermal radiation of fuel gaseous components is considered in detail in this work in contrast to other reported work in the literature. The effect of thermal radiation on SOFC performance is shown by comparing with a model without this factor. Simulation results indicate that at higher inlet fuel flow pressures and also larger SOFC lengths the effect of thermal radiation on SOFC temperature becomes more significant. In this study, the H2 and CO oxidation is also studied and the effect of CO oxidation on SOFC performance is reported. The results show that the model which accounts for the electrochemical reaction ofCO results in better SOFC performance than other reported models. This work also reveals that at low inlet fuel flow pressures the CO and H2 electrochemical reactions are competitive and significantly dependent on the CO/H2 ratio inside the triple phase boundary.","[Hajimolana, S.

Grafting yield, conductivity, spectroscopic, thermal analysis and surface morphology study manifested that VIm was successfully grafted onto the PVDF backbone. The finding showed that grafting yield increased in the PVDF membrane associated with absorbed dose. In fact, the surface morphology of the membrane observed homogenous when grafting with the VIm after irradiation that in compliment with XRD study. The PVDF-co-VIm membrane is expected to be a promising candidate for the PEM fuel cell.","[Lepit, A.; Aini, N. A.; Jaafar, N. K.; Hashim, N.; Ali, A. M.

Impedance spectroscopy results showed that the proton conductivities of zeolites in the operating temperature range of 24-100 degrees C were enhanced significantly to higher values (about 1-3 orders of magnitude) by loading of sulfonic acids onto the surface of zeolite. Proton conductivities were correlated with the concentration of sulfonic acid groups and increased as follows: sulfonated polystyrene ZSM-5 > phenylsulfonic acid functionalized ZSM-5 > propylsulfonic acid functionalized ZSM-5 which is in line with the ion-exchange capacity, acidity and water uptake analysis.

Both isothermal and non-isothermal simulations are applied in designing a laboratory-scale proof-of-concept reactor. Isothermal sensitivity analysis indicates parameter adjustments practically available to improve reactor performance. In non-isothermal simulations, catalyst layer thickness and kinetic pre-exponential factor are varied along the reactor length. Predictions indicate that the reforming methane conversion increased from 74?% to 91?%, while avoiding hot spots.

The composite PES/SPEEK membranes at various composition of SPEEK are prepared by the phase inversion method. The membranes are characterized by measuring roughness, proton conductivity, oxygen diffusion, water crossover and electrochemical impedance. The conductivity of hydrophobic PES membrane increases when a small amount (3-5%) of hydrophilic SPEEK is added. The electrochemical impedance spectra shows that the conductivity and capacitance of PES/SPEEK composite membranes during MFC operation are reduced from 6.15 x 10(-7) to 6.93 x 10(-5) (3197 Omega-162 Omega) and from 3.00 x 10(-7) to 1.56 x 10(-3) F, respectively when 5% of SPEEK added into PES membrane. The PES/SPEEK 5% membrane has the highest performance compared to other membranes with a maximum power density of 170 mW m(-2) at the maximum current density of 340 mA m(-2). However, the interfacial reaction between the membrane and the cathode with Pt catalyst indicates moderate reaction efficiency compared to other membranes. The COD removal efficiency of MFCs with composite membrane PES/SPEEK 5% is nearly 26-fold and 2-fold higher than that of MFCs with Nafion 112 and Nafion 117 membranes respectively. The results suggest that the PES/SPEEK composite membrane is a promising alternative to the costly perfluorosulfonate membranes presently used as separators in MFC systems.

LSCF-based cathodes with different designs were brushed onto co-extruded nickel-gadolinium-doped ceria (CGO) anode/CGO electrolyte dual-layer HFs (< 1 mm ID) fabricated by PI. The effect of cathode layers on the overall performance of the fuel cells (FCs) was assessed using nearly identical anode and electrolyte compositions, thicknesses, and microstructures. Cathode microstructure design caused cells to perform differently producing peak power densities of 0.35-0.7 W cm(-2) at 600 A degrees C. Impedance spectroscopy analysis at 600 A degrees C on the FCs produced 0.12-0.24 Omega cm(2) confirming the cathode's structural effect on the overall area-specific resistance of the FCs.

Recent experiments indicated that the sputtered sulfonate could lead to a decrease of hydrophilicity of Nafion when bombarded by a low energy Ar+ beam. To investigate the surface modification at the atomic level, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and experiment were carried out. The effects of Ar+ at 0.5-3.0 keV, and doses in the range of 10(14)-10(15) ions cm(-2) on the damage of the Nafion surface after bombardment were deduced from the simulations. This was assessed through both the chemical and physical changes of the Nafion side chain. The potential dissociation of the C-S bond after bombardment was analyzed in terms of the elongated bond population. The percentage of the extended C-S bond in the system was calculated to determine the possibility of sulfonate sputtering. Real-time determination of the amount of molecular species defragged under Ar+ ion bombardment by quadrupole mass spectroscopy (QMS) was used.

The highest conductivity at room temperature is 7.72 x 10(-4) Scm(-1) for sample containing 35 wt. % DTAB. The temperature dependence of the BEs system exhibits Arrhenius behavior. The conductivity of the samples was found to be dependent on the number of mobile ions and the mobility of the ions. It has been shown that the conducting species in this present work are predominantly due to proton (H+) which was confirmed via FTIR and TNM analysis.

SPEEK with 63% of degree of sulfonation (DS) was prepared by sulfonation of PEEK. Cloisite15A (7.5 wt %) along with various weight loading of TAP was incorporated into SPEEK matrix via solution intercalation method. The effect of TAP loading on the SPEEK/Cloisite15A/TAP morphology was studied. The beneficial impact of the SPEEK/Cloisite15A/TAP morphology on the physicochemical properties of the membrane was further discussed. Swelling behavior, ion exchange capacity (IEC), proton conductivity, and methanol permeability of the resultant membranes were determined as a function of Cloisite15A and TAP loadings. Uniform distribution of Cloisite15A particles in the SPEEK polymer matrix in the homogenous SPEEK/Cloisite15A/TAP nanocomposite membranes was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The water uptake of the SPEEK nanocomposite membranes decreased dramatically in the presence of TAP.

The effect of fuel/air temperature and pressure will be investigated. Controlling the average stack temperature is the final objective of this study due to a high operating temperature of the system. In this case, temperature fluctuation induces thermal stress in the electrodes and electrolyte ceramics; therefore, the cell temperature distribution should be kept as constant as possible. A mathematical modeling based on first principles is developed. The fuel cell is divided into five subsystems and the factors such as mass/energy/momentum transfer, diffusion through porous media, electrochemical reactions, and polarization losses inside the subsystems are presented. Dynamic fuel-cell-tube temperature responses of the cell to step changes in conditions of the feed streams will be presented. A neural network predictive controller (NNPC) is then implemented to control the cell-tube temperature through manipulation of the temperature of the inlet air stream. The results show that the control system can successfully reject unmeasured step changes (disturbances) in the load resistance.","[Hajimolana, S. A.; Hussain, M. A.; Daud, W. M. A.

The introduction of nitrogen into carbon nanostructures has created new pathways for the development of non-noble metal electro-catalysts in fuel cells. This review provides insight into the role of nitrogen inclusion into the carbon nanotubes (CNT) and the possible mechanisms involved in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The doping effects of nitrogen into CNT on the surface morphology, electronic structures and electrochemical activity are discussed. Catalyst nanoparticles distribution, chemical composition and the incorporation of a binder play crucial roles in the generation of good catalytic activity and high stability in organic electro-catalysts. Synthesize methods for making nitrogen-containing carbon nanostructures and the resultant oxygen reduction reactivity are compared. Finally, stability issues of the N-CNT electrocatalysts are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The EPD method frequently employs organic or non-aqueous solvent for the fabrication of SOFC components especially electrolyte. In this study, the LSCF6428 film was developed via the EPD method using an aqueous solvent. To begin with, 1 wt% of LSCF6428 powder was suspended in deionised water. The EPD process was then applied on the suspension with pH3. An increase in the applied voltage (3-7 V) and deposition time (3-10 min) was found to contribute to the increased amount of the deposited LSCF6428 films. With reference to the higher amount and uniform deposition of films, the use of starch as an additive material has been shown to successfully improve the quality of the deposited films. The applied voltage and drying conditions must be carefully selected in order to avoid cracking of the deposited films. The results showed strong dependence of the morphology and weight of the LSCF6428 films on the applied voltage, deposition time and the use of additive materials in the EPD process.","[Muchtar, Andanastuti; Haron, Syaharizan; Muhamad, Norhamidi; Abdullah, Huda] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fak Kejuruteraan Dan Alam Bina, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor De, Malaysia; [Rahman, Hamimah Abd.] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Sel Fuel, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor De, Malaysia","Muchtar, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fak Kejuruteraan Dan Alam Bina, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor De, Malaysia.",muchtar@eng.ukm.my,"Abdullah, Huda/H-9717-2016; Abd.Rahman, Hamimah/N-3563-2016","Abd.Rahman, Hamimah/0000-0001-5258-3656; Muchtar, Andanastuti/0000-0002-1599-8964",,,,21,3,3,0,2,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,SELANGOR,"FACULTY SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, BANGI, SELANGOR, 43600, MALAYSIA",0126-6039,,,SAINS MALAYS,Sains Malays.,FEB,2012,41,2,,,,,237,244,,,,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,886AY,WOS:000299823900013,,,,,1/2/2021,

A 77 wt.% Pd/23 wt.% Ag membrane with 25 mu m thickness and CuO/ZnO/ Al2O3 catalyst were used. Heating was performed by a Bunsen type burner using City Gas 13A. The methanol reforming and purification of H-2 were investigated at different reference catalyst zone temperatures (589-689K), pressures at the retentate side (0.2-0.5MPa), steam to methanol(S/C) ratios (0.8-1.6) and reactant flow rates (1.7 x 10(-4) to 4.4 x 10(-4) mol/s). The results show that at high reference temperature, high pressure and certain points of the reactant flow rate, the maximum hydrogen permeation rate is obtained when the S/C ratio is around 1. The modified Sieverts' equation which considers the decrease in H-2 concentration at the membrane surface, was proposed. The experimental result was lower than the permeation rate estimated by the modified Sieverts' equation, which is probably caused by the adsorption of non-H-2 species during permeation. It is further demonstrated that the modified Sieverts' equation is able to estimate a more reasonable hydrogen permeation rate in comparison to the estimation by the ordinary Sieverts' equation. In addition, it is shown that the compact methanol steam reformer with a Pd/Ag membrane is able to produce high purity hydrogen with very low CO concentration, which fulfills the Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell (PEFC) requirement (<10ppm).","[Faizal, Hasan Mohd; Kuwabara, Masato; Kizu, Ryo] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Kouhoku Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan; [Yokomori, Takeshi; Ueda, Toshihisa] Keio Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kouhoku Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan; [Faizal, Hasan Mohd] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Mech Engn, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia","Faizal, HM (corresponding author), Keio Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Kouhoku Ku, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan.",mfaizal@a3.keio.jp,"Yokomori, Takeshi/F-7646-2014; Yokomori, Takeshi/AAS-4984-2020; Ueda, Toshihisa/C-9650-2014","Yokomori, Takeshi/0000-0003-3087-940X; Yokomori, Takeshi/0000-0003-3087-940X; ","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, and Technology in JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Ministry of Higher Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia","This work was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for the Global Center of Excellence Program for the Center for Education and Research of Symbiotic, Safe and Secure System Design from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, and Technology in Japan.

SDC-(Li/Na)(2)CO3 composite is an excellent ionic conductor that is potentially viable for use as an electrolyte material for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFC). Characterisation of the composite electrolyte includes the morphology, surface area, thermal analysis and porosity of the electrolyte pellets. The fabrication of the SDC-(Li/Na)(2)CO3 electrolyte composites were achieved in two steps: (1) preparation of the samarium-doped cerium powders by sol-gel and (2) mixing of the samarium-doped cerium with carbonates in various compositions by solid state reaction. The electrolyte pellets were compacted at different pressures (25, 50, 150 and 200 MPa) and sintered at 500, 600, 700 and 800 degrees C. The XRD results demonstrated that the introduction of carbonates did not change the SDC phase structure. FESEM images showed that the carbonate component was amorphous and well distributed in the SDC matrix. The greater the carbonate content in the composite, the smaller the surface area. Thermal analysis indicated that the melting point of the carbonate phase decreased with a reduction of the fraction of carbonate content. The optimum porosity most suitable for LT-SOFC electrolytes, 3.38% and 4.85%, were achieved for samples with carbonate content of 20% (SDC8020) and 30% (SDC7030), respectively. These were for samples sintered at 600 degrees C and cold pressed at 200 MPa.","[Raharjo, Jarot; Muchtar, Andanastuti; Daud, Wan Ramli Wan; Muhamad, Norhamidi; Majlan, Edy Herianto] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Sel Fuel, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor De, Malaysia; [Raharjo, Jarot] Badan Pengkajian Dan Penerapan Teknol, Pusat Teknol Mat, Jakarta 10340, Indonesia","Muchtar, A (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Sel Fuel, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor De, Malaysia.",muchtar@vlsi.eng.ukm.my,"Muchtar, Andanastuti/E-3806-2017; Majlan, Edy Herianto/N-9636-2017; Daud, Wan Ramli/B-3635-2013","Muchtar, Andanastuti/0000-0002-1599-8964; Majlan, Edy Herianto/0000-0001-9327-7153; Daud, Wan Ramli/0000-0002-1023-456X; Raharjo, Jarot/0000-0002-6962-1919",,,,17,5,5,0,16,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,SELANGOR,"FACULTY SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, BANGI, SELANGOR, 43600, MALAYSIA",0126-6039,,,SAINS MALAYS,Sains Malays.,JAN,2012,41,1,,,,,95,102,,,,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,886AN,WOS:000299822700011,,,,,1/2/2021,

Methods and Results: Microbial fuel cells enriched with palm oil mill effluent (POME) were employed to harvest bioenergy from both artificial wastewater containing acetate and complex POME. The microbial fuel cell (MFC) showed maximum power density of 3004 mW m(-2) after continuous feeding with artificial wastewater containing acetate substrate. Subsequent replacement of the acetate substrate with complex substrate of POME recorded maximum power density of 622 mW m(-2). Based on 16S rDNA analyses, relatively higher abundance of Deltaproteobacteria (88.5%) was detected in the MFCs fed with acetate artificial wastewater as compared to POME. Meanwhile, members of Gamma-proteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria codominated the microbial consortium of the MFC fed with POME with 21, 20 and 18.5% abundances, respectively. Conclusions: Enriched electrochemically active bacteria originated from POME demonstrated potential to generate bioenergy from both acetate and complex POME substrates. Further improvements including the development of MFC systems that are able to utilize both fermentative and nonfermentative substrates in POME are needed to maximize the bioenergy generation. Significance and Impact of the Study: A better understanding of microbial structure is critical for bioenergy generation from POME using MFC. Data obtained in this study improve our understanding of microbial community structure in conversion of POME to electricity.","[Jong, B. C.; Liew, P. W. Y.; Juri, M. Lebai; Dzomir, A. Z.

This study presented a novel organic-inorganic hybrid membrane with several different compositions by casting mixtures of zirconium phosphate (ZP), polybenzimidazole (PBI) and Nafion dispersion in dimethylacetamide. The presence of PBI and ZP in the membranes was demonstrated with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, it was observed that the hybrid Nafion-PBI-ZP membrane had the finest structure. This is because the synthesized films were homogeneous and therefore formed a dense membrane. The water content was higher in the hybrid membrane: 39.91% compared with 35.52% in Nafion117. The water content is important for the ion transportation in the membrane; therefore, a higher water uptake rate will contribute to a better fuel cell performance. It was determined that the proton conductivity of the hybrid membrane was 0.020 S cm(-1), which was comparable with Nafion117, which had a proton-conductivity of 0.022 S cm(-1). The methanol permeability of the hybrid membrane was 2.34 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1), while the value for Nafion117 was 8.91 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1). This showed that the methanol permeability of the hybrid membrane was almost 4 times lower than that of Nafion117. The selectivity factor for the Nafion-PBI 1%-ZP 1% membrane was 8.64 x 10(4) Scm(-3), while that of Nafion117 was 2.48 x 10(4) S scm(-3). From a thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), the addition of PBI and zirconium phosphate was shown to improve the thermal durability in the temperature range from room temperature to 450 degrees C over that of Nafion117. This study proofed that the Nafion-PBI 1%-ZP 1% performed better than commercial Nafion117 and other type of membranes. The membrane was tested on as single cell of DMFC. It gave the highest power density as compared to other type of membrane and proofed that it has potential to be used in DMFCs. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The effect of clay loading on the physical properties of SPEEK nanocomposite membranes was investigated. SPEEK mixed with 2.5 wt.% of Cloisite15A (R) (SP63/2.5Cl) has been identified as the best composite formulation in this study. Subsequently, various amounts of 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine (TAP) were further incorporated into SP63/2.5Cl formulation. The effect of TAP incorporation on the physical and performance properties of the membranes was studied. Nanometer scale distribution of Cloisite15A (R) in the SPEEK polymer matrix has been achieved by the assistance of TAP, as observed by the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). A complete exfoliated nanocomposite structure of SP63/2.5Cl/5.0TAP was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The increase of Cloisite15A (R) content in the SPEEK membrane has dramatically improved the swelling behavior and barrier properties towards methanol. The SP63/2.5Cl/5.0TAP polymer-clay nanocomposite membrane served as a promising alternative proton exchange membrane (PEM) for DMFC applications with superior DMFC performance compared to commercial Nafion (R) 112.

PG and electrodeposited AuNPs were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results have shown that the smallest size of gold particles (20 +/- 8 nm) was deposited on the PG substrate with almost spherical geometry at scan rate of 12500 mV s(-1).

The chemical and physical activation was carried out by KOH reagents and CO2 gas to increase the electrode surface area and the catalytic activity. As a result, it was found that the MFC with the chemically activated carbon nanofibers (ACNFs) exhibited better catalytic activity than that of the physically activated ACNFs. Chemically ACNFs with 8 M KOH were found to be one of the most promising candidates for the ORR and could generate up to 3.17 times more power than that of the carbon paper. The ACNFs with 8 M KOH exhibited 78% more power generation than that of the physically activated ACNFs and exhibited 16% more power generation than the chemically activated ACNFs with 4 M KOH. The power per cost of ACNFs with 8 M KOH is 2.65 times greater than that of the traditionally used platinum cathode. Thus, ACNFs are a good alternative catalyst to Pt for MFCs.

However, they have been major contributors to environmental problems. One potential alternative to explore is the use of microbial fuel cells (MFCs), which generate electricity using microorganisms. MFCs uses catalytic reactions activated by microorganisms to convert energy preserved in the chemical bonds between organic molecules into electrical energy. MFC has the ability to generate electricity during the wastewater treatment process while simultaneously treating the pollutants. This study investigated the potential of using different types of mixed cultures (raw sewage, mixed liquor from the aeration tank & return waste activated sludge) from an activated sludge treatment plant in MFCs for electricity generation and pollutant removals (COD & total kjeldahl nitrogen, TKN). The MFC in this study was designed as a dual-chambered system, in which the chambers were separated by a Nafion (TM) membrane using a mixed culture of wastewater as a biocatalyst.

A mixture of SPEEK-chitosan (SPEEK-CS) membrane was prepared by dissolving SPEEK in dimethyl sulphoxide and CS in acetic acid. The homogen formed was later irradiated with an ultraviolet (UV) source to induce cross-linking. The time of UV irradiation has been found to influence the performance of the membrane's conducting properties. The composite membranes are prepared through the general formula of SPEEK(x)CS((1-x)), where x=0.3. The cross-linked membrane with an irradiation time of 120 min of 300 W UV is found to achieve the highest proton conductivity values. In addition, the water uptake behaviour is also found to be proportional to its proton conductivity. All the membranes lost an average of 10 mass-% at the temperature of similar to 240 degrees C.","[Aini, N. A.; Lepit, A.; Jaafar, N. K.; Harun, M. K.; Ali, A. M. M.; Yahya, M. Z.

This issue is very critical when fuel cell experiences water flooding. In this work. Two-dimensional partially flooded GDL models are proposed to study local current density distributions along flow fields over a wide range of cell operating conditions. The model results show a direct association between cathode inlet humidity increases and that of average current density but the system becomes more sensitive to flooding. The anode inlet relative humidity shows a similar effect. Operating the cell at higher temperatures would lead to higher average current densities and the chance of system being flooded is reduced. In addition, higher cathode stoichiometries prevent system flooding but the average current density remains almost constant. The higher anode stoichiometry leads to higher average current density and higher sensitivity to cathode flooding. (C) 2010 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Fuel cells are a potential power source for electric vehicle or distributed power generation system. In electric vehicle application, a high power boost dc-dc converter is adopted to adjust the output voltage, current and power of fuel cell engine to meet the vehicle requirements. The major challenge of designing a boost converter for high power application is how to handle the high current at the input and high voltage at the output. In this paper, a high voltage ratio interleaved boost dc-dc converter is proposed for stepping-up the voltage on high power application. A prototype of converter system was built. The experimental waveforms of the high voltage ratio interleaved boost converter are presented.

Thus, the objective of the present study was to develop a passive direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) for portable electronic devices. The power output of six dual DMFCs connected in series with an active area of 4 cm(2) was approximately 600 mW, and the power density of the DMFCs was 25 mW cm(-2). The DMFCs were evaluated as a power source for mobile phone chargers and media players. The results indicated that the open circuit voltage of the DMFC was between 6.0 V and 6.5 V, and the voltage under operating conditions was 4.0 V. The fuel cell was tested on a variety of cell phone chargers, media players and PDAs. The cost of energy consumption by the proposed DMFC was estimated to be USD 20 W-1, and the cost of methanol is USD 4 kW h. Alternatively, the local conventional electricity tariff is USD 2 kW h. However, for the large-scale production of electronic devices, the cost of methanol will be significantly lower. Moreover, the electricity tariff is expected to increase due to the constraints of fossil fuel resources and pollution. As a result. DMFCs will become competitive with conventional power sources.

The SiO(2) layer was grown in a wet thermal oxidation process to obtain a thickness of up to 6.5 mu m and the growth was predicted using the Deal-Grove model. The flow fields on the cathode and anode sides were done using a wet etch process with KOH as etchant. Etching time was utilized to control the depth of the required pattern and the pattern shape was found to have an influence over the etch rate. With constant monitoring of the conditions and parameters used throughout the micro-fabrication process, the thick SiO(2) layer was found to be a reliable masking material for a long KOH etching.

Several characterizations such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) were carried out in order to confirm the entrapment of STA molecule onto MMT. It was found that the STA possessed good adhesion with MMT due to the low STA leaching from the composite membranes. The SPEEK modified membranes with the newly developed material, SMMT (with 30 and 50 wt% STA entrapped onto MMT) were characterized and its performance was compared with pristine SPEEK and Nafion 112 membranes. The FESEM micrograph confirmed that the fillers were well dispersed in the membrane. The results also revealed that the water uptake and proton conductivity at ambient temperature and 100% relative humidity of the composite membranes were higher than the pristine SPEEK membrane which were (49.50 +/- 1.67) wt% water uptake and (6.08 +/- 0.65) x 10(-3) S cm(-1) for 50SMMT, respectively. On the other hand, the lowest methanol permeability of the developed membranes in this study was (3.50 +/- 0.53) x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1) which was lower than the Nafion 112 membrane.

Performance ratings for different criteria are measured by different units, but in the decision matrix in order to have a valid comparison all the elements must be dimensionless. However, a lot of normalization methods have been developed for cost and benefit criteria, not only there has not been enough attention for engineering design situations in which approaching the target values are desirable but also the available methods have shortcomings. A new version of VIKOR method, which covers all types of criteria with emphasize on compromise solution, is proposed in this paper. The proposed comprehensive version of VIKOR also overcomes the main error of traditional VIKOR by a simpler approach.

Differential scanning calorimetry, universal mechanical testing and scanning transmission electron microscopy were used to evaluate the thermal, mechanical and structural changes developed in the membranes during the preparation procedures. Physicochemical properties such as water uptake, hydration number and ionic conductivity were studied as functions of ion-exchange capacity and the results obtained were correlated with the structural changes accompanying each preparation method. Membranes obtained using the SSGM were found to have superior properties compared to their counterparts prepared using the CTSGM suggesting the former method is more effective than the latter for imparting desired functionality and stability properties to the membranes.

The reaction order of the monomer concentration and absorbed dose of grafting was found to be 2.84 and 1.20, respectively. The overall activation energy for graft copolymerization reaction was calculated to be 11.36 kJ/mol. The initial rate of grafting was found to decrease with an increase in the film thickness. The trapped radicals in the irradiated PVDF films remained effective in initiating the reaction without considerable loss in grafting level up to 180 days, when stored under -60 degrees C. The presence and distribution of polystyrene sulfonate grafts in the obtained membranes were observed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis, scanning optical microscope and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) coupled with X-ray energy dispersive (EDX), respectively.

In such a context, alternative solutions are needed to reduce the impact of these agricultural wastes on the environment. The present paper investigates the effect of addition of agricultural waste materials on the combustion behavior of its blends with metallurgical coke (MC). Two types of agricultural waste materials, palm shell and coconut shell, were mixed in different proportion with MC, while the gas phase reactions were studied at 1 200 degrees C in a drop tube furnace (DTF). In the tested conditions, the blends containing agricultural waste materials indicated higher combustion efficiencies compared to MC alone. Carbon structure analysis were performed through (CP)-C-13/MAS NMR spectroscopy showing various groups of carbons present in the agricultural waste samples ranging from aliphatic to aromatic carbons. The morphology of the samples was studied through Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). SEM provided a qualitative description of the pore structure in the raw samples as well as the changes occurring following the gas phase reactions in the DTF. It was found that the particles derived from the wastes became increasingly deformed and lost their cell lumen. Surface area measurements were found to be in good agreement with the SEM images, supporting the higher combustion efficiency of the blends in comparison to coke alone. The present study suggests that agricultural waste materials have the potential to partially replace MC, as an auxiliary fuel in metallurgical processes.","[Yunos, Nur Farhana Mohd; Zaharia, Magdalena; Nath, Dilip; Sahajwalla, Veena] Univ New S Wales, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Ctr Sustainable Mat Res & Technol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Yunos, Nur Farhana Mohd; Ahmad, Khairel Rafezi] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Mat Engn, Kubang Gajah 02600, Perlis, Malaysia; [Iwase, Masanori] Kyoto Univ, Dept Energy Sci & Technol, Thermochem Res Grp, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","Yunos, NFM (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Ctr Sustainable Mat Res & Technol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",n.f.mohdyunos@student.unsw.edu.au,"Yunos, Nur Farhana Diyana Mohd/I-2598-2019; AHMAD, KHAIREL RAFEZI/AAK-8057-2020","Yunos, Nur Farhana Diyana Mohd/0000-0003-1256-0286; AHMAD, KHAIREL RAFEZI/0000-0002-6160-8998; Sahajwalla, Veena/0000-0001-9528-9967","Ministry of Higher Education, MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia","Financial support for the PhD student, Nur Farhana M.

In this work, ion conductive polymer electrolyte membranes have been prepared for battery fabrication. However, fractals were found to grow in these polymer electrolyte membranes weeks after they were prepared. It was believed that the formation of fractal aggregates in these membranes were due to ionic movement. The discovery of fractal growth pattern can be used to understand the effects of such phenomenon in the polymer electrolyte membranes. Digital images of the fractal growth patterns were taken and a simulation model was developed based on the Brownian motion theory and a fractal dialect known as L-system. A computer coding has been designed to simulate and visualize the fractal growth.","[Amir, S.; Ali, S. A.

The grafting reaction, known for its poor kinetics, was studied using SSS diluted in various solvents and solvent/acid solutions of different concentrations and volumes. The addition of acid solution was found to marvelously synergize the grafting reaction from very low values (e.g., 0.5%) to achieve high degrees (e.g., 65%) of grafting and such synergetic effect depends on the type, concentration and volume of the added acid. The degree of grafting was also found to be function of the monomer concentration and the irradiation dose at constant acid concentration and volume. The obtained membranes were investigated with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The results of present study reveal that grafting of SSS to levels suitable for fuel cell application onto PVDF film is only possible by adding aqueous acids solution. Moreover, the addition of acid makes this shorter single-step method more economical route for preparation of proton exchange membranes for fuel cells. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Several methods have been devised to connect an energy-storage device to an FC. This paper presents a converter system for connecting an ultracapacitor as secondary energy storage to an FC electric-vehicle system. A bidirectional dc-dc converter is used for interfacing ultracapacitor energy storage to an FC system. The controller of the converter system was designed and implemented based on dynamic evolution control.

Sago is a type of natural polymer, was employed as the polymer host for the electrolyte. An electrolyte with a composition of sago + 6 M KOH + 2 M NaBH4 was prepared and evaluated as a novel gel polymer electrolyte for a direct borohydride fuel cell system because it exhibited a high electrical conductivity of 0.270 S cm(-1). The rate at which oxygen was consumed at the cathode can be related to the electric current by comparing the calculated number of electrons reacted per molecule of oxygen for different currents supplied to the fuel cell. From the oxygen consumption data, it was deduced that four electrons reacted per molecule of oxygen. The performance of the fuel cell was measured in terms of its current voltage, discharge and open circuit voltage measurements. The maximum power density obtained was 8.818 mW cm(-2) at a discharge performance of similar to 230 mA h and nominal voltage of 0.806 V.

The membranes were found to undergo substantial structural changes in forms of ionic sites increase, hydrophilicity enhancement, hydrophobicity reduction and crystallinity decrease with the variation in G (%) and the preparation method. The structural and thermal properties of the obtained membranes were also compared with their counterparts prepared by a conventional two-steps method i.e. radiation induced grafting of styrene onto EB irradiated PVDF films followed by sulfonation. The PVDF-g-PSSA membranes obtained by a single-step method were found to have superior properties compared to those obtained by the conventional two-steps method.","[Nasef, Mohamed; Saidi, Hamdani] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Inst Hydrogen Econ, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia; [Nasef, Mohamed; Saidi, Hamdani] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Chem & Nat Resources Engn, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Dahlan, Khairulzaman Mohd] Agensi Nuklear Malaysia, Radiat Proc Technol Div, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia","Nasef, M (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Inst Hydrogen Econ, Int City Campus, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia.",mahmoudeithar@fkkksa.utm.my,,,"Malaysian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI)Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia; International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)International Atomic Energy Agency","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support from the Malaysian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) under Science Fund program.

The cost-effectiveness of the present solar PV system and the solar/hydro schemes for rural electrification of the rural ICT are evaluated employing the HOMER simulation software, considering sustainability, factors such as system efficiency, weather, fuel costs, operating and maintaining costs. Subsequently, simple novel Hybrid Energy Performance Equations and the associated Energy Performance Curves are derived and introduced, respectively, which provide a visualization model, simplifying hybrid system analysis. Results obtained in this study have shown that combined power schemes is more sustainable in terms of supplying electricity to the Telecenter compared to a stand-alone PV system due to prolong cloudy and dense haze periods. The hybrid systems can have efficiency range of similar to 15%-75% compared to PV stand-alone of only similar to 10%, indicating hybrid systems are more reliable and sustainable - in minimizing both energy losses and excess energy.

They have higher efficiency and lower emissions compared with the internal combustion engine vehicles. The fuel cell has a high energy storage capability, thus enhancing the range of operation for automobile and is a cleaner source of energy. However, the fuel cell has a slow dynamic response, so an auxiliary power source is needed during start up and transient conditions. Ultracapacitor usually used as secondary power source for improving the performance and efficiency of the overall system. Several methods have been devised to connect ultracapacitor to the fuel cell system. If the ultracapacitor is connected in parallel directly with the dc bus, its charge and discharge current cannot be controlled Once the load changes significantly, the rush current would destroy the ultracapacitor. Therefore, a bidirectional converter needs to be inserted between the dc bus and the ultracapacitor to control the charge and discharge current. This paper proposes a novel control strategy of bidirectional dc-dc converter for interfacing ultracapacitor energy storage to fuel cell electric vehicles system. The controller of bidirectional dc-dc converter system was designed and implemented based on dynamic evolution control. Performance of the proposed dynamic evolution control is tested through simulation and experiment. Copyright (C) 2010 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved","[Samosir, A. S.; Yatim, A. H.

The fuel cell is completely passive with no auxiliary device such as pump or fan. Oxygen is taken from the surrounding air, and the methanol solution is stored in a built-in reservoir. The performance of the single cell is tested with different methanol concentrations ranging from 1.0 M to 5.0 M, and the optimum performance is achieved by using methanol at a concentration of 4.0 M. A stack with 6 cells is fabricated and tested with the optimum methanol concentration of 4.0 M, and power levels produced by different catalyst loadings on the anode are compared. Besides, this study also considers the cost analysis of micro-DMFC. The combination of a catalyst loading of 3.0 mg cm(-2) Pt/Ru on the anode and 2.0 mg cm(-2) Pt on the cathode yield the highest power of 12.05 mW at 1.08 V and 11.2 mA.

The structural parameters (r(p) and A(k)/Delta x) and electrostatic properties (xi and X) of the blend membranes were deduced by employing the combination of irreversible thermodynamic mode steric hindrance pore (SHP) model and Teorell-Meyyer-Sievers (TMS) model. The modeling results obtained have been analyzed and discussed. The mean pore radius and pore size distribution of the blends were also determined based on the theoretical models. The results showed that pore radius increased with increasing the concentration of SPEEK from 0 to 2 wt % but decreased with a further increase in SPEEK content. The water flux however showed a systematically increase with increasing SPEEK content. The SPEEK also showed significant effect on membrane electrical properties. Both effective charge density and ratio of effective charge density to electrolyte solution increased with increasing concentration of SPEEK in the dope solution reaching a value of -21.02 and -2.29 respectively. The pore radius which was determined by using different transport models has also been analyzed and discussed. It is found that the addition of SPEEK into dope solution is one of the paramount parameters in developing the negatively charged nanofiltration membrane with enhanced water flux while retaining the pore radius in the nanometer rnage.

Imbalance between production and evaporation rates can result in either flooding of the electrodes or membrane dehydration, both of which severely limit fuel cell performance. In the present study, a mathematical model was developed to evaluate moisture profiles of hydrogen and air flows in the flow field channels of both the anode and the cathode. For model validation, a single fuel cell was designed with an active area of 200 cm(2). Six humidity sensors were installed in the flow fields of both the anode and the cathode at 457 mm, 1266 mm and 2532 mm from the inlets. The experiment was performed using an Arbin Fuel Cell Test Station. The temperature was varied (25 degrees C, 40 degrees C, 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C), while hydrogen and air velocities were fixed at 3 L min(-1) and 6 L min(-1), respectively, during the operation of the single cell. The feed relative humidity at the anode was fixed at 1.0, while the feed relative humidity at the cathode was fixed at 0.005 (dry air). All humidity sensor readings were taken at steady state after 2 h of operation. Model predictions were then compared with experimental results by using the least squares algorithm. The moisture content was found to decrease along the flow field at the anode, but to increase at the cathode. The moisture content profile at the anode was shown to depend on the moisture Peclet number, which decreased with temperature. On the other hand, the moisture profile at the cathode was shown to depend on both the Peclet number and the Damkohler number. The trend of the Peclet number in the cathode followed closely that of the anode. The Damkohler number decreased with temperature, indicating increasing moisture mass transfer with temperature. The moisture profile models were successfully validated by the published data of the estimated overall mass transfer coefficient and moisture effective diffusivity of the same order of magnitude. The strategy of saturating the hydrogen feed and using dry air, as in the present work, has been shown to Successfully prevent water droplet formation in the cathode, and hence prevent flooding.

SiWA was fixed on stable structure (composite oxide) so that it became insoluble in water. The SPEEK polymers were characterized using H NMR and FTIR. XRD analysis was performed on the inorganic proton conducing fillers to reveal the existence of the interaction between SiWA and composite oxide. The membrane structural properties and surface morphologies were characterized with SEM and their performance were examined in terms of proton conductivity, water uptake and methanol permeability. It was found that the presence of inorganic proton conducting fillers led to both high water uptake and proton conductivity (maximum value 6.1 x 10(-2) Scm(-1)). Low methanol permeability values were recorded for the membranes which appeared as a very promising material to be used in DMFC. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Ismail, A.

A CPSA system was designed by combining four adsorption beds that simultaneously operate at different processes in the pressure swing adsorption (wPSA) process cycle. The overall diameter of the cylindrical shell of the CPSA is 35 cm and its height is 40 cm. Several suitable adsorbent materials for CO and CO2 adsorption in a hydrogen stream were identified and their adsorption properties were tested. Activated carbon from Sigma-Aldrich was the adsorbent chosen. it has a surface area of 695.07 m(2)/g. CO adsorption capacity (STP) of 0.55 mmol/g and CO2 at 2.05 mmol/g were obtained. The CPSA system has a rapid process cycle that can supply hydrogen continuously without disruption by the regeneration process of the adsorbent. The process cycle in each column of the CPSA consists of pressurization, adsorption, blowdown and purging processes. CPSA is capable of reducing the CO concentration in a H-2/CO/CO2 mixture from 4000 ppm. to 1.4 ppm and the CO2 concentration from 5% to 7.0 ppm CO2 in 60 cycles and 3600 s. Based on the mixture used in the experimental work, the H-2 purity obtained was 99.999%, product throughput of 0.04 kg H-2/kg adsorbent with purge/feed ratio was 0.001 and vent loss/feed ratio was 0.02. It is therefore concluded that the CPSA system met the required specifications of hydrogen purity for fuel cell applications. 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Sulfur content of the cSMMs was analyzed by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy and elemental analysis to be in the following order: PEG200-HBS > PEG400-HBS > PPG-HBS, which was also the order for their glass transition temperature (T-g). The control and modified membranes were characterized by contact angle measurement, thermal analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and water uptake. The modified SPEEK membrane surfaces were more hydrophilic on the top surfaces than the bottom surfaces as indicated by the water contact angle and by XPS, confirming the stronger migration of cSMM to the top than the bottom surfaces. The cSMM has migrated and formed -SO3 dense layer-like on top and bottom surfaces of the modified membrane. The morphology study of the membrane surfaces showed that the nodule size and surface roughness has also influenced the water uptake, apart from the additional -SO3 group. The modified membranes were tested for methanol permeability and proton conductivity. Employing PEG200-HBS has resulted in the smallest nodule size, the lowest water uptake and the lowest methanol permeability. On the contrary, employing PPG425-HBS had the largest nodule size, the highest water uptake and the highest proton conductivity. The proton conductivity is more dependent on the capability of the membrane to sorb more water rather than the additional -SO3 group introduced by the cSMM. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of the study is to fabricate Nafion-SiO2-PWA nanocomposite membrane using sol-gel reaction. The composite is composed of the mixture of Nafion solution, tetra ethoxy orthosilane (TEOS) and PWA solution. The mixed solution was casted at certain temperature until transparent membrane is obtained. Peaks of SiO2 and PWA in the infrared spectra revealed that both inorganic and organic components are present in the modified Nafion based nanocomposite membrane. Analysis with fuel cell test station showed that higher current density was produced by nanocomposite membrane (82 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V for NS15W) than with the Nafion membrane (30 mA cm(-2) at 0.2 V) at 90 degrees C and 40% relative humidity. The internal resistance was seen to increase with the inorganic content. The internal resistances of the commercial Nafion (N112), NS10W, NS15W and NS20W are 6.33, 4.84, 1.33 and 3.6 Omega cm(2), respectively and their Tafel constants are 93.4, 84.4, 11.25 and 26.6 mV, respectively.

Bioconversion of synthesis gas (syngas) to hydrogen was dernonstrated in continuous stirred tank bioreactor (CSTBR) utilizing acetate as a carbon source. An anaerobic photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodospirillum rubrum catalyzed water-gas shift reaction which was applied for the bioconversion of syngas to hydrogen. The continuous fermentation of syngas in the bioreactor was continuously operated at various gas flow rates and agitation speeds, for the period of two months. The gas flow rates were varied from 5 to 14 ml/min. The agitation speeds were increasingly altered in the range of 150-500 rpm. The pH and temperature of the bioreactor was set at 6.5 and 30 degrees C. The liquid flow rate was kept constant at 0.65 ml/min for the duration of 60 days. The inlet acetate concentration was fed at 4 g/l into the bioreactor. The hydrogen production rate and yield were 16 +/- 1.1 mmol g(-1) cell h(-1) and 87 +/- 2.4% at fixed agitation speed of 500 rpm and syngas flow rate of 14 ml/min, respectively. The mass transfer coefficient (KLa) at this condition was approximately 72.8 h(-1).

The composites have relatively low electrical conductivities, i.e., up to 28 S cm(-1) at 90 wt.% G. Combination of G with carbon black (CB) is an effective way to develop higher conductivity composites. The conductivity reaches 35 S cm(-1) by combination of 25 wt.% CB and 55 wt.% G to 20 wt.% PP. This is five times the value at 80 wt.% G and 20 wt.% PP (7 S cm(-1)). Two methods are mainly adopted for the preparation of composites, namely, melt compounding and solution blending. Solution blending of PP with conductive fillers followed by moulding of the dried powder leads to higher conductivities compared with those of melt-compounded composites. The combination of conjugated conducting polymers such as polyaniline (PANi) with the PP, G, and CB is also investigated. It is found that composites containing PANi have lower conductivities than those of the neat composites. This decrease in conductivity is attributed to the poor thermal stability of PANi.

Effects of reaction conditions: monomer concentration, irradiation dose, temperature, film thickness and storage time on the grafting yield (Y%) were studied. The initial rate of grafting was found to be heavily dependent on the monomer concentration and the irradiation dose and can be represented by the following equation: dG(0)/dt = k[M-0](2.0)[D](0.75). The overall activation energies for graft copolymerization were calculated to be 36.9 and 12.5 kJ/mol below and above 50 degrees C. respectively. The initial rate of grafting was found to decrease with the increase in the film thickness. The trapped radicals in the irradiated ETFE films were found to be highly effective in initiating grafting reaction up to 240 days when stored under -60 degrees C. Graft copolymerization in the present study essentially depends on the ability of the monomers to diffuse through the base film and the amount of the trapped radicals. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of the boron/phosphate (B/P) fraction of BPO4 and relative loading are discussed. These effects include membrane permeability to methanol and proton conductivity. The results showed that the proton conductivity of the composite membrane at room temperature increased with reduction of BPO4's B/P. However, the trade-off trend was exhibited in methanol permeability results. A 20 wt.% of BPO4 enhanced proton conductivity which deteriorated suddenly upon further loading. In comparison with Nafion((R)) 117, the composite membranes have demonstrated better methanol separator property. The highest proton conductivity value of the composite membrane was 3.35 x 10(-3) S/cm, and this value is adequate for DMFC application even though slighity lower than the proton conductivity of Nafion((R)) 117 membrane.

In this study, a proton electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system is taken as a case study. The overall system consists of five major units, namely auto-thermal reformer (ATR), water gas shift reactor (WGS), membrane, pressure swing adsorber (PSA) and fuel cell stack. Besides that, the process utilities like compressor, heat exchanger, water adsorber are also included in the system. From the result, it is determined that the specific cost of a PEM fuel cell stack is about US$ 500 per kW, while the specific manufacturing and capital investment costs are in the range of US$ 1200 per kW and US$ 2900 per kW, respectively. Besides that the electricity cost is calculated as US$ 0.04 kWh. The results also prove that the cost of PEM fuel cell system is comparable with other conventional internal engine.

The Rice and Roth model was used to explain the variations in the conductivity observed. The exponent, n, in Joncsher's universal power law equation sigma(omega) = sigma(dc) + A'omega(n) was analyzed as a function of temperature for the chitosan sample containing 41 vol% H3PO4. The analysis suggests that the conduction mechanism follows that proposed by the overlapping large polaron tunneling model. The chitosan membranes can be used as electrolytes in solid state batteries, electric double layer capacitors and fuel cells. However, there is still scope for improvement.

The effects of variation of the grafting yield (Y%) on the ionic conductivity and the methanol permeability of the membranes are investigated. The ionic conductivity of the membranes increases with increase in Y% and exceeds that of the perfluorinated ionomer membrane, Nafion 117, at a grafting yield of 46%.

They generate no noise, vibration or air pollution and are therefore suitable for use in many vibration-free power-generating applications. In this study, a mini alkaline fuel cell signal detector system has been designed, constructed and tested. The initial results have shown the applicability of such system for used as an indicator of signal disturbance from cellular phones. A small disturbance even at 4 mV cm(-1), corresponding to an amplitude of 12-18 mG in terms of electromagnetic field, can be well detected by such a device. Subsequently, a thermodynamics model has been developed to provide a parametric study by simulation to show the likely performance of the fuel cell alone in other environments. As such the model can provide many useful generic design data for alkaline fuel cells. Two general conclusions can be drawn from the present theoretical study: (i) fuel cell performance increases with temperature, pressure and correction factor, C-f; (ii) the temperature factor (E/T) increases with increasing temperature and with increasing pressure factor.

The review also discuss the remaining research and development issues that still need to be resolved before these fuel cells are available for commercial application. The main thrust in PEMFC research and development is to lower the cost of the fuel cell by reduction in membrane and electrocatalyst costs.

Porous PVDF films were grafted by pre-swelling in styrene solution and subsequent irradiation with an electron beam (EB) under nitrogen atmosphere and at ambient temperature. The grafted films i.e. polystyrene (PS) pore-filled PVDF were subsequently suffonated with a diluted mixture of chlorosufonic acid. The effects of the reaction parameters on the content of PS grafted in the pores of PVDF films were investigated. The chemical and morphological properties of the membranes in comparison with their un-grafted and grafted counterparts were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The transport properties of these membranes such as ionic conductivity and methanol permeability were evaluated and correlated with the content of PS grafted in the pores of the PVDF films. The PSSA pore-filled PVDF membranes with PS content in the pores of 40% and above showed superior performance characteristics compared to Nation 117 membrane and therefore can be potential alternatives to improve the performance of direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC).

The analysis showed that a MEA surface with the catalyst layer consisting of 10 wt% Pt/C and 30,wt% Teflon((R)) (PTFE, designated E2) loaded with 0.38 mg Pt/cm(2) showed good localisation of the platinum particles. The SEM image of the E2 electrode showed the existence of a diffusion layer, while the cross-section of electrode E3 (without diffusion layer) showed only the backing layer of the carbon cloth. It was seen that good adhesion of the catalyst on the membrane was obtained as a result of the hot press used in fabrication. XPS analysis showed that the electrode surfaces consisted of C, O, F, Si and Pt, whose binding energies for the PTFE/C layer were C 1s, O 1s, F 1s and Si 2p states and were 285.0, 532.7,689.5 and 103.0 eV, respectively. While for the catalyst layer, the binding energies for the elements, C Is, 0 Is, F Is, Si 2p and Pt 4f states, were 284.3, 532.4, 689.3, 102.9 and 74.1 eV, respectively. Similar observations we, re made for a commercial E-TEK electrode. The mathematical and simulation investigations supported the hypothesis made in an earlier study in terms of optimum PEM fuel cell performance determination and design simulation. The calculated values of the voltage operational limit V-opl cal. agreed quite well with the experimental data V-opl exp. reported earlier. Other works from the open literature were also correlated using the mathematical model, and it was found that the V-opl values were comparable.

The first section describes the auto-thermal reformer (ATR) system while the second section demonstrates the significance of the water gas shift (WGS) reaction in the system. Shortcut design methods are used for the process units and the characterization curve for each unit is also presented. Kinetic parameters for steam reforming and WGS reactions are also shown. The 5 kW PEMFC requires about 0.08 m(3)/min (3.74 mol/min) of H-2 fuel at the fuel cell stack. The primary fuel source to the ATR system is methanol 0.1 m(3) /min (4 mol/min), which is fed together with steam and oxygen with the ratio of S/C and O-2/C at 1.3:1 and 1:4, respectively. The conceptual design indicates that if the mole ratio of O-2/C is 0.20-0.25, then the hydrogen selectivity is around 2.5-2.6 for complete methanol. Steam is fed at excess condition in both units, ATR and WGS, to avoid reverse WGS reaction. The conceptual design also proved the significance of WGS reaction in the reduction of CO produced in the ATR and indicated the importance of pressure to reduce the bulk size of WGS reactor. Finally from the overall mass balance for fuel processor unit, the ATR product contains H-2: 73%, CO: 2%, and CO2: 25%. The CO level is then further reduced to less than 2000 ppm after the WGS reactor. In addition, this paper also studied the performance of preferential oxidation (PROX) in removing the CO and it was observed that the PROX could reduce the CO to less than 100ppm and performed better than WGS reaction in terms of water management. However, the main problem with PROX is to decide a good catalyst that can give a good selectivity for CO oxidation rather than water formation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Initially, as a model development of the system, this paper tends to focus on the overall system design of the fuel cell. Basically, the system consist of five major units, namely; Auto-thermal reformer (ATR), water gas shift reactor (WGS), membrane, pressure swing adsorber (PSA) and fuel cell stack. The ATR and WGS are designed based on the rate of reaction and variations in volume. For membrane unit, the expression of the length and surface area are simplified in terms of NTU and HTU. The PSA process is quite complicated and there are many parameters to be decided; therefore, we simplify the design of the PSA by introducing Daud bed utilisation factor. For the stack design, the voltage for single cell, number of cells required, current density, power density and finally the current flow in the stack are determined in this study. The material and heat balance of the system are also presented here. Finally the overall fuel cell efficiency is also determined. System with power output as 5 kW of PEMFC is taken as a case study. Methanol is taken as a primary fuel source to the ATR system, which is fed together with steam and oxygen. The conceptual design indicates that if the mole ratio of O-2/MeOH is 0.20-0.25, then the hydrogen selectivity is around 2.5-2.6 for complete methanol conversion. With that the ratio of MeOH:H2O and MeOH:O-2 are taken as 1:1.3 and 1:0.25, respectively. The conceptual design also proves that WGS reaction plays a very important role in the reduction of the CO produced in the ATR. In the conceptual design, the ATR product contains H-2: 73%, CO: 2%, and CO2: 25%. The CO level is then further reduced to less than 2000 ppm in the WGS reactor. Hydrogen-rich reformate, which is produced by reforming primary fuels in the fuel processor system contains significant amount of CO, is further reduced by tubular ceramic membrane (TCM) and a pressure swing adsorber (PSA) in series. From the overall material balance, it is observed that the final concentration of hydrogen is purified to 99.99% with the concentration of CO is reduced to less than 10ppm before entering the fuel cell stack. Finally this paper will calculate the overall heat balance of the system in order to calculate the power plant efficiency. The gross efficiency of the system is calculated as 49.3% while the net efficiency of the system after considering the parasitic load is estimated as 45.5%. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Functional genomic analysis of these genes will undoubtedly reveal their physiological roles in cells in the near future. Coupled with the advent of DNA microarray, cellular response to perturbation can now be examined at genome-wide levels in a single analysis, yielding clues to the network of pathways and interacting pathways that underlie a comprehensive systems response to exposure to small molecule perturbants. This post-genomic information will be the foundation for knowledge-based in silico systems biology. It is envisioned that querying such relational databases will generate testable hypotheses as well as revealing information on networks of regulatory genes and pathways that could further fuel and shape molecular and drug target discovery, and ushering in a new era in genomic medicine. In this review, we will first discuss examples of laboratory results generated from high-throughput microarray analyses that illuminated previously unrecognized networks of regulatory genes and pathways that point to the mechanisms of action for the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, and the green tea polyphenol, epi-gallocatechin gallate. We will then focus on the application of gene expression profiles in genomic medicine for predicting treatment response in cancer, using clinical specimens obtained from patients. These studies and others point to an increasing trend in modern biology in which high-throughput genome scale comprehensive biological information is incorporated into databases for constructing and reconstructing pathways and networks of interacting pathways that constitute a physiological response to environmental perturbation at the organism or systems levels.

Generally, it explains the permeation of the multi component gas using cross flow models in a porous membrane and the surface area of the membrane required. The novel aspect of this method is that the expression for the length of the membrane is simplified to a number unit (NTU) and a height of transfer unit (HTU). The HTU term for porous membranes is characterised by the physical properties of the membrane; the feed flow rate, n(F), membrane thickness, l(M) feed pressure, P-F K the permeability of gas and the diameter of the membrane, D-M. The integral for NTU of a porous membrane is the solution for the local permeate along the length of the membrane. It is found that, NTU mainly depends on the rejection stream, x(R), along the membrane and it describes the relative degree of separation. The Proton Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) system is taken as the case study. CO is the main culprit in reducing the performance of the PEMFC and will act as cl catalyst poison for the fuel cell anode at a concentration as low as 100 ppm. Thus, the retormate, from primary reforming,contains a significant amount of CO and must be purified. The effect of some important parameters such as temperature, pressure and the thickness of membrane to the degree of separation are presented in this paper. From the results, it can be seen that the system could reduce the CO concentration from 2000-500 ppm. Basically the TCM will operate, in series, with a pressure swing adsorber in order to further reduce the concentration of CO to less than 10 ppm before entering the fuel cell stack. However, this paper only focuses on the design of the TCM. Besides this, it is observed that the purity of the hydrogen increased from 72.8-96% (at theta = 0.5) after the membrane.","[Kamarudin, S.

The degree of grafting was found to be dependent on the grafting parameters including irradiation time and DVB concentration in the bulk solution. The physico-chemical properties of the membranes such as ion exchange capacity, water uptake and ionic conductivity were evaluated in correlation with the degree of grafting and the level of crosslinking. All the properties of the membranes were found to be functions of the degree of grafting. However, crosslinking of polystyrene grafts with DVB was found to considerably reduce the water uptake and the ionic conductivity of the membranes while showing no effect on the ion exchange capacity. The thermal stability of the membranes represented by desulfortation temperature was found to be independent of crosslinking. Membranes having degrees of grafting of 24% (0% DVB), 24% (2% DVB) and 17% (4% DVB) possess good combinations of physico-chemical properties and can be of practical interest.

The performance of the electrodes increases with increase in Pt loading in the catalyst layer. The performance of the E2 electrode is superior to that of E1, E-TEK or E3. Elimination of the diffusion layer between the carbon-cloth substrate and the catalyst layer affects the performance of electrode E3 in particular. The power density shows a similar pattern to current density. The difference in performance between E2 and E-TEK electrodes may be due to the difference in the method of fabrication. Increase in exchange current density results in an increase in efficiency. The curves for E1, E2 and E-TEK electrodes appear to stabilize at constant efficiency, which indicates maximum efficiency at a lower exchange current density, compared with the E2 electrode, which does not approach a steady efficiency even at an exchange current density of 1 mA cm(-2). This means that the E2 electrode has greater efficiency than E1, E3 or E-TEK electrodes. Voltage and irreversibility curves for the four electrodes meet at different voltage operational limits; namely, 0.48, 0.55, 0.46 and 0.42 V at 1.2, 0.85, 0.4 and 0.3 mA cm(-2), for E-TEK, E2, E1 and E3 electrodes, respectively.

The membrane was prepared by radiation-induced grafting of styrene onto PFA film using simultaneous irradiation technique followed by sulfonation reaction. The membrane was initially analyzed in its virgin state and the obtained data was used as a reference. The XPS results showed that the used membrane has undergone substantial structural changes, particularly in terms of chemical composition and concentration of its basic elemental components (Carbon, fluorine, oxygen and sulfur) as a result of degradation. This was found to be mainly due to the decomposition of polystyrene sulfonic side chain grafts. These results were confirmed by FTIR spectral analysis. It can be suggested that the oxidative degradation taking place in the PFA-g-PSSA membrane during fuel cell test is mostly due to the chemical attack at the tertiary hydrogen of a-carbon of polystyrene side chain grafts. Moreover XPS can be proposed as an effective tool for monitoring membrane degradation after fuel cell experiments.","Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Chem Engn Program, Tronoh 31750, Perak, Malaysia; Univ Teknol Malaysia, Membrane Res Unit, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia","Nasef, MM (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Chem Engn Program, Bandar Seri Iskandar, Tronoh 31750, Perak, Malaysia.",mahmoudeithar@mailcity.com,,,,,,22,17,17,0,4,ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE MONTREAL,MONTREAL,"C P 6079, SUCC CENTRE-VILLE, MONTREAL, PQ H3C 3A7, CANADA",1480-2422,,,J NEW MAT ELECTR SYS,J.

However, the reformer effluent contains about 75% hydrogen and 25% carbon monoxide (CO) by volume. Reformation with a good catalyst could yield a 1% CO content in the effluent, but 1% CO, which is equivalent to 10,000 ppm CO, has a poisoning effect on the platinum (Pt) catalysts of the PEM fuel cell electrodes. Since the catalyst can only tolerate CO of less than 100 ppm, it is then expedient to introduce a purification system to reduce the CO content to the required concentration. To achieve this, activated carbon (AC)-SnO2 adsorbent was synthesized and used in a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) system. Consequently, 34.57% SnCl2.2H(2)O salt as a tin ion precursor, was impregnated onto activated carbon to improve its adsorptive interaction with CO. A model H-2/CO mixture, representing the stoichiometric ratio of H-2 and CO in the steam reformer affluent gas was used. It was observed that the amount of CO adsorbed was almost equal to that desorbed, which implies that the adsorption of CO on the prepared adsorbents is reversible. Further exploitation of the impregnated activated carbon in PSA experiments showed that adsorption of carbon monoxide was higher with the impregnated carbon than in the pure carbon. Within the limits of analytical error, it was seen that the concentration of carbon monoxide, which was 1000 ppm, was successfully reduced to 40.2 and 10.4 ppm by the pure and the impregnated activated carbons, respectively. These results confirmed that Sn-activated carbon in the PSA system could be used in the purification of hydrogen. The species responsible for the improved gas phase CO adsorption with the impregnated carbon was found to be SnO2. Consequently, the high adsorptive selectivity of AC SnO2 towards gas phase CO, when compared to that of the pure carbon, confirms its superiority and applicability in the removal of CO. This phenomenon then indicates a good future for the robustness of this promising adsorbent, since CO remains a major contributor to the current level of the global air pollution problems.","Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Environm Chem & Engn, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia","Iyuke, SE (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Environm Chem & Engn, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",,,,,,,11,0,0,0,11,INST CHEMICAL ENGINEERS,RUGBY,"165-189 RAILWAY TERRACE, DAVIS BLDG, RUGBY CV21 3BR, ENGLAND",0263-8762,,,CHEM ENG RES DES,Chem.

Besides the fact that activated carbon has its original different pore sizes for normal gas phase CO adsorption (as in case of pure carbon), the impregnated carbon has additional CO adsorption ability due to the presence of O-(ads) on the active sires. The use of AC-SnO2 in adsorbing CO proved superior to that when pure carbon was used for H-2 purification in a PSA system.

The chemical compositions of the surfaces of the membranes were found to be dependent on the degree of grafting unlike the binding energies of their elemental components (C, F, O, and S), which were found to be independent of the degree of grafting. The atomic ratio of F/C was found to decrease drastically with the increase in the degree of grafting and the membranes were found to have almost pure hydrocarbon structure at the layers close to their surfaces where degradation is suggested to be concentrated.

The possibility of carbon formation in these conditions is determined by direct inclusion of carbon in the objective function of the minimization scheme. Results showed that the area of carbon formation region is surprisingly high.
